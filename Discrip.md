Dev release of EAW: Equestria Divided Reunification.

<b>Coding Conventions</b>

<u>Events</u>
Events should be named as follows...
- The prefix should be the TAG they apply to, the region (see region guide), or GLOBE for global. There is only one exception, being event verbosity.
- The midpoint should apply to the act it belongs to. act01 always defines a TAGs start of the game.
* Acts should ideally follow certain recognized parts of the game up to act 5.
- There should be three digits in the suffix. 00 is reserved for act critical news events.
+ After that the two digits are in sequencial order based on what focus they relate to.
- The final digit applies to sequences within order, say an event related to a focus triggers a chain. The third digit should indicate events related to the sequence.
* Legacy events (or rather pre-NSB) shall retain only 2 digits, the first marking the relation and the second marking the related sequence.
