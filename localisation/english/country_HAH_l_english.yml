###National Focuses###
##Storyline Tree - Act 1##
HAH_S00: "Under Their Domain"
 HAH_S00_desc: "Hollow Shades is such a backwater little town, but now that I am at the helm perhaps something can finally be done with this place. Canterlot bestowed me with this power and I intend to make sure I show my gratitude. Oh it is like my dreams as a colt where I was the ruler of my own little kingdom! But enough fawning and merry making, it is time that I get to work. A time for play can come later."
 HAH_evt_a01.001.t: "Rules of Dominion"
 HAH_evt_a01.001.d: "When Canterlot put me in charge of this little back water they made sure to stress just how important it was that I kept up with demand. Now normally that would be a simple little thing to do, but alas the former caretaker of this place was not very keen on those demands; instead, only continuing the punishment of the ponies who live here. Could he not see that one can meet demand and deal out punishment? Before I can properly begin the little thing I was sent here to do, I must meet these demands. They even sent me a lovely group of soldiers to help make sure that they are met. How nice of them."
 HAH_evt_a01.001.a: "What a lovely day in Hollow Shades."
  HAH_evt_a01.001.a_tooltip: "At the request of the §2Equestrian House of Lords§!, §1Prince-Consort Shining Armor§! has sent us a §YLegionary Detachment§!.\n§RThis division and it's template are locked§!."
 HAH_evt_C-FF_W-TY.r: "§gCredits§!: §LWritten§! by §CTiviyl§!, §LCoded§! by §CFairfir§!."
 HAH_S01A: "A Demand for Timber and Stone"
 HAH_S01A_desc: "The engineers within Canterlot can not build without lumber now can they? It seems that although my predecessor was at least meeting that quota, he was very sloppy about doing so. With only a little time, zoning, and organization shipments of lumber will start being sent up in a much more timely manner."
 HAH_S01B: "Grain Quotas"
 HAH_S01B_desc: "Those ponies in Canterlot love both their parties and their armies, but you can have neither without the proper amount of grain. This land has good soil for where it is and those back in Canterlot know that. I can not promise mountains of the stuff, but I can at least promise enough to help out."
 HAH_S01C: "A Quota for Steel"
 HAH_S01C_desc: "Canterlot seems to be always in need of steel these days and the steel mills just can not seem to keep up. An order was sent out from the head unicorn herself a while ago that all the outer territories should be producing steel. Sadly under the old caretaker this place has yet to start any meaningful production. Thankfully there is an unfinished steel mill within town. It should take no time at all to get up and running."
 HAH_S02: "Now On to Business"
 HAH_S02_desc: "Now with the demands of Canterlot satisfied for the time being, I can begin to work on what I was sent to this backwater to do."
 HAH_evt_a01.021.t: "Back to Business"
  HAH_evt_a01.021.d: "Misty Whisps Sat within the town’s old library. Pondering over a few over a few thoughts aloud as he gazed into a mirror.\n\nWith the demands and quotas met for the time being, it is time that I begin my actual work. I came to the inquisition with the little proposal of a sort of wonder drug. They seemed interested enough to provide me with a little funding and a place to do my research. In return they were expecting me to produce some kind of results within the year. Well I did just that, I was able to produce a little concoction like I promised them. However, when I was sent out here to test it, the carriage carrying the stuff crashed into a river. The entire batch that I had made lost because of some reckless driver. Does the inquisition care though? Hell no, they do not. All they want is the results.\n\nIf I am going to have any chance of making a new batch and start the testing process I am going to need a few things. I am going to need my equipment shipped here, a supply of the proper ingredients, and my old friend brought here to help me. All of this will take time. Time that I have little of. In the meantime I am going to have to begin working on other little schemes to keep the inquisition and the rest of Canterlot off of my back."

 HAH_evt_a01.022.t: "The Luxuries of The Capital"
  HAH_evt_a01.022.d: "I would be lying to myself if I did not admit that I greatly miss the luxuries afforded to me back in the capital. Libraries, fine food, the arts, and other grandeur are all treasures afforded to any unicorn under the banner of Moon and Star. However out here, those things are how do you say non existent here. I bet with a few little projects the unicorns here will become more welcoming to their new status in life under Canterlot. More importantly it should also keep the inquisition happy. They always seem to love seeing fellow unicorns realizing their new positions."
  HAH_evt_a01.022.a: ""
  HAH_evt_a01.022.h: "§gDebug§!: §RRevert§! event effects."
 HAH_D03A: "A Grander Library"
 HAH_D03A_desc: "If there is one thing that this small town needs it is books, books, and more books! Now there is a small library here in town, but it is nothing like those you would find back in the capital. Though I can not commission such grand works here, what I can do is have more texts shipped in and expand the library here. It will take a little time, but I am more then sure it will be worth it."
 HAH_D03B: "The Glory of the Theatre"
 HAH_D03B_desc: "Who does not love the arts? Especially when it is the art of the theater. A simple amphitheater would take little time to construct, and would bring some much needed culture to the unicorns around here. Not only that, but perhaps it could also be used to host little lectures of knowledge and mythics. Oh Misty, you are a genius!"
 HAH_evt_a01.032.t: "The Patronage of the Arts"
  HAH_evt_a01.032.d: "Within days of the amphitheater's completion, word of mouth had brought the curiosity of several passersby. Many among them sought to experience what it would offer, plying their trades at opportunity. Day by day a community of storytellers began to establish itself, sharing their knowledge of folklore and legend. The most oft of such would be Clover the Clever and Starswirl the Bearded. Others would enter such circles in time. The locals have begun work to organize festivals around such events. With a little bit of funding the bread and circuses may yet improve the usual dour mood of Hollow Shade's citizens."
  HAH_evt_a01.032.a: "If music be the food of love play on."
  HAH_evt_a01.032.h: "§gDebug§!: §RDeactivate§! §YBread and Circuses§! decisions."
 HAH_D03C: "Statues to Their Gods"
 HAH_D03C_desc: "One thing I know for sure will keep the inquisitors off of my back for a while will be to build some kind of temple or shrine to the lost princesses. Who knows maybe it will even raise some morale around here to see them in some kind form again. I will commission a statue maker back in Canterlot to build some statues and then to build a shrine for each of them."
 HAH_D03D: "Whispering Wisp Manor"
 HAH_D03D_desc: "There is a rather old and dashing looking house on the outskirts of the town. It requires a lot of work, but I can see it becoming quite a lovely manor for myself. I could host waltzes, parties, and more from within a grand ballroom. Just like the ones back home in Canterlot. Surely it would raise the spirits of those here. Who knows it may also draw some of my old friends from Canterlot here as well."
 HAH_evt_a01.035.t: "An Informal Attire"
  HAH_evt_a01.035.d: "After weeks of restoration and renovations, the newly christiened Whispering Wisp Manor was completed."
  HAH_evt_a01.035.a: "§RAssasinate§! §YBall and Chain§!"
 HAH_S04A: "Bubble Bubble"
 HAH_S04A_desc: "Now that everything is in place we can begin the process of brewing the new batch. However it will take time for me and Willow to brew up another batch. I just hope that we can get a working batch in time. We will also need a place to safely mess with these chemicals."
 HAH_evt_a01.041.t: "Production Begins"
  HAH_evt_a01.041.d: "A dash of lithium, a few sprigs of lavender, and a hoof full of other things is what is required to make this concoction. Things that are not easy to come by in this world anymore. Thankfully through some of my old connections in Canterlot I have been able to get my hooves on a little bit of each. Just enough to make a few batches to begin the testing. What is even better is the fact that we actually found an old factory on the outskirts of town that can be used to hide away all of the equipment and ingredients. One of the serfs mentioned it was some kind of old toy factory or something before the great division. Hopefully none of these hoof dragging legionnaires gets an idea to fiddle with any of this stuff and cause anymore delays. I do not think the inquisition will take kindly to any more delays no matter what they are."
  HAH_evt_a01.041.a: "Hark!"
 HAH_S04B: "Toil and Trouble"
 HAH_S04B_desc: "With the new batch completed, we can finally begin testing. I will have the legionaries round up a few of the serfs from the outer parts of the region. No one should raise an eyebrow if somepony goes missing there."
 HAH_evt_a01.042.t: "A Bad Batch"
  HAH_evt_a01.042.d: "No, no, no! The testing could not have gone worse. We got five ponies together and gave them each an injection of the concoction. Test subjects one and two survived the testing process for lack of a better term. It stayed in their systems for about three days before it wore off. However, during those three days it was noted that they were rather violent. Test subjects 3 and 5 both went mad around the second day. Saying that it felt like everything was watching them with soulless, deminted eyes. Needless to say they both had gone mad. And as for test subject 4, she died from her heart exploding. It seems like her heart could not handle it. Blast it all to hell! The inquisition is demanding results after all of the money and time they have given me, and what do I have to show for it?! Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\nWillow Believes that he may have some kind of solution. A different mixture of measurements and the inclusion of a rather odd ingredient. I just hope that his little idea works. If it does not, I fear that my lovely coat collar may be getting stained red."
  HAH_evt_a01.042.a: "But What of Cador?"
 HAH_S05: "Willow's Solution"
 HAH_S05_desc: "After working for days my dear friend and I may have finally brewed a miracle. Tonight we are bringing back those same four test subjects as before and testing this stuff out."
 HAH_evt_a01.051.t: "Willow's Solution"
  HAH_evt_a01.051.d: "We were actually able to do it! Or well in a way we did it I guess. The new concoction actually worked. Not as I had planned, but worked nonetheless! Test subjects one and two from before responded to this new batch rather well. Both were less violent during the three days of testing, and both responded well to suggestions. Test subjects three and five from before responded just as well. Both noted that they could no longer see or feel all of those eyes watching them. However, I did note that we only got it working in a way. Yes we accomplished the goal, but all four test subjects had this rather eery joyfulness to them while the concoction was in their systems.\n\nThat little side effect matters little though. What does matter however is the fact that we are onto something and I finally have findings to report to the inquisition. Perhaps now they will get off of my case. All this being said, I can not thank Willow enough for what he has done these past few months. I decided that since he is the one who perfected it, he should be the one to name it. That silly fool suggested to name it Tranquility. I would say it is silly, but with the odd happiness the test subjects had during testing I find it oddly fitting."
   HAH_evt_a01.051.a: "Excellent!"

##Storyline Tree - Act 2##
HAH_S06A: "An Unforseen Issue"
 HAH_S06A_desc: "When we sent the test subjects back to their villages with tranquility in their systems, we had a few legionaries tail them just to keep me informed about how they acted. As it turns out what happened was rather unpleasant."
 HAH_evt_a02.061.t: "The Attack"
  HAH_evt_a02.061.d: "While returning back to their abodes three out of the four test subjects displayed rather joyful behavior, that is until three of them came across some pony who looked rather upset. Test subject three was noted to have started vehemently questioning why the other pony was so unhappy. Insisting that they should be smiling like he was. Eventually aftering getting frustrated with the random pony he went on back to his cottage.\n\nTest subjects one and two however were a much different story. While on their way back to wherever it was they called home they came across a crying stallion next to a well. They did the same as number three when he came across a rather unhappy pony. Questioning and badgering him about why his was not smiling. However, what happened next was different, and much more admittedly tragic. The stallion tried to get away from the two test subjects, but was stopped by them and then was viciously beaten by the two of them until the legionaries tailing them stepped in.\n\nBoth I and Willow are confused by what happened today, and can not come up with an explanation as to why neither of us or the legionaries sent with them were not attacked or confronted like that. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact our faces could not be seen by them? Could it be that those who are on tranquility can not stand the sight of someone who is not happy like they are? This will take time to further understand."
  HAH_evt_a02.061.a: "Hmmm..."
 HAH_S06B: "To Protect Those Who Are Yet to be Tested On"
  HAH_S06B_desc: "What happened with those three test subjects is still greatly bugging me. We can not proceed with any more testing until we discover if the theory is true!"
  HAH_evt_a02.062.t: "Misty’s Solution"
   HAH_evt_a02.062.d: "Misty and Willow were sitting within the old factory having tea. Trying their best to devise a plan of some kind to test their theories about why the test subjects reacted so strangely to the ponies who looked sad. After much deliberation and thought, Misty would spring up in exclamation. “I have it! We could throw a grand masquerade! We will pawn it off as a sort of three days of rest and festivities. It will provide us with the understanding we need of those on tranquility, but also provide a sort of uplift to the rest of the region. Keeping the serfs happy and in check. Canterlot and the inquisition will think that we have gone mad, but to tarderous with them, we could kill two birds with one stone!” Willow could only smile and nod along in agreement to his old friend’s idea. Willow knew that Misty could be foolish and even overly ambitious a lot of the time. However, when it came to matters such as this, he could not think of any brighter unicorn to dream up solutions."
   HAH_evt_a02.062.a: "Stupendous"
 HAH_S07A: "The Masks"
  HAH_S07A_desc: "We can not have a grand masquerade without masks, and I know a few artists back in Canterlot who would love the business. It would have to be a simple mask to keep it cheap, but also one that has a smile built into it so we can actually study our theory."
  HAH_evt_a02.071.t: "The Masks"
   HAH_evt_a02.071.d: "The masks finally arrived in the river port today, and dear sisters they are unsettling. The porcelain white masks all fit what I had asked the artists to make. Each of them were just a little different here and there, but all had the same main features. The raised cheeks and shape of the eyes together would make the wearer look like they were smiling. Willow seems to think that they are not that bad, and will work just fine to test the theory we have. Still though, I can not help but be just a little unsettled by the look of the things."
   HAH_evt_a02.071.a: "Graci"
 HAH_S07B: "The Breads"
  HAH_S07B_desc: "Although it will be a tough sell, I could try and see if the other serf states around me could spare us some wheat. Say it is to ease the burdens of a bad harvest or something. They will not like sharing, but it will give us the grain we need."
  moonstar_seeth_opinion: "They took our grain!"
 HAH_S07C: "The Wine"
  HAH_S07C_desc: "There was an old beekeeping operation that was in operation here before the division. In more recent times however, it is a shadow of its former glory. The earthy who ran it was replaced by a unicorn who had no idea what she was doing after Hollow Shade’s surrender. I bet with a little work and string pulling I could get that place working again and get the honey flowing again. If I can do that then we can get honey wine for the masquerade!"
  HAH_evt_a02.074.t: "The Grand Masquerade"
   HAH_evt_a02.074.d: "The province of Hollow Shades had begun its grand masquerade. For the next three days all ponies within the region, from the wealthiest unicorn, down to the lowest earth pony serf, were all encouraged to take part in the festivities. Many did just that, however not without looks of distrust and anger from the legionaries and members of the inquisition within the region. Because for those few days, all races would intermingle and gather much like how they did when Equestria was united. For those few short days it almost seems like everypony within these lands are equal.\n\nFearing what may happen, the inquisition had sent extra forces down to the region after hearing such an event was taking place. When the soldiers arrived they had been expecting insurrectionist chaos, but instead found ponies merely enjoying a festival. They were greeted by Misty and told to enjoy the festivities if they so wished while they were in town. A few even joined in on the fun.\n\nMisty was right, his overlord was not pleased with such an event taking place. But he got the data he and Willow wanted. Now further testing can begin."
   HAH_evt_a02.074.a: "Hmmm"
   HMS_to_HAH_disapproval: "We Disapprove of Your Actions."
 HAH_S08: "It Is Not Just A Theory"
  HAH_S08_desc: "The theory we had was correct, but how do we even handle this now?!"
  HAH_S08_tooltip: "§GUnlocks the Military and Economic Trees.§!"
  HAH_evt_a02.081.t: "Mandated Masks"
   HAH_evt_a02.081.d: "While sitting in the factory pouring over the notes he and Willow had taken about the test subjects during the masquerade, Misty could not help but feel conflicted. He and Willow had done it. They had made a concoction that would cut down on chaos and rebellion, but at a cost. Those on the drug would express anger and outrage if they saw a face of anyone who was not happy or contempt. He has little options going forward. After seeing the results from the tests the inquisition has ordered him to increase his testing. One of the inquisitorial staff even wants to know what the test subjects would be like as soldiers.\n\nSeeing little options he has come up with a drastic decision. That being all residents of Hollow Shades must wear the masquerade masks provided to them whenever they leave their homes. Maybe doing that will prevent unnecessary more attacks from those on the drug. However the ponies here will find this new rule rather odd."
   HAH_evt_a02.081.a: "It's For Their Own Good"
 HAH_S09A: "Increased Production"
  HAH_S09A_desc: "If we are to increase the amount of testing like the inquisitors wish us to, then we need more space and equipment to brew it. We shall have the serfs begin building onto the old factory while I order more equipment."
 HAH_S09B: "Willow’s Ingredient"
  HAH_S09B_desc: "With a need to increase production comes a need to increase the import or production of ingredients. Everything in the drug can be imported from here or there with ease. Everything apart from the one thing Willow added to the mixture to make it work. That being petals of dried poison joke. We can not really import stuff like that, even with my connections. However, what we can do is start a little farm of the stuff here in Hollow Shades."
  HAH_evt_a02.092.t: "Farming Poison Joke"
   HAH_evt_a02.092.d: "Well I was wrong, Willow seems to think that we do not need a full farm of the stuff. Instead he believes that all we really need is the amount you would get out of a small greenhouse. So, after the construction of the greenhouse I began working on finding a way to get poison joke plants or seeds here. That is not something Canterlot will easily allow coming through its borders. However, I always found a way in the past to get my hooves on oddities and this will be no different. Perhaps along with the poison joke I could have one of those flower bushes Willow likes so much shipped in as well."
   HAH_evt_a02.092.a: "Canterlot doesn't need to know."
 HAH_S09C: "The Bobbies"
  HAH_S09C_desc: "One of those inquisitorial busy bodies wants to know if these test subjects would be useful as a type of soldier. Despite my misgivings about the idea, I have to go through with these tests. I am going to dub these test subjects Bobbies. Now the only issue is finding the test subjects viable enough to make them."
  HAH_evt_a02.093.t: "The Bobbies"
   HAH_evt_a02.093.d: "After a month of testing, calculations, and experimentation me and Willow were able to give the inquisition what they asked for. A small division of ponies pumped full of Tranquility. We even outfitted them with blue uniforms. Making them look like a police force in a way instead of a militia or military group. However, during the testing Willow had noticed that our drug can be rather addictive to those taking it, and for some the high comes to a thunderous crash once it wears off. Dear sisters, the screams I heard coming from some of them when their high wore off. For now, the inquisition wishes to see how they act while around civilians. So not only do they look like a police force, they basically are one now."
   HAH_evt_a02.093.a: "We shall see."
   HAH_bobbies: "The Bobbies"
    HAH_bobbies_desc: ""
 HAH_S09D: "The Constables"
  HAH_S09D_desc: "With the question of a military use of the drug in the air, Willow had suggested a little test for us to put into motion. Subjects one and two from the original tests will be given the rank of Constable within the region's new and experimental militia. To go along with these new roles they will be given uniforms and much higher doses of Tranquility from now on. Hopefully they will do good in such a role."
 HAH_S10A: "Project Flu Season"
  HAH_S10A_desc: "With the increased production of Tranquility we can now begin testing on much larger groups of ponies within Hollow Shades. I have been looking for a way to increase our ability to test Trainquility, and Willow in his never ending brilliance was able to crystalize the drug."
  HAH_evt_a02.101.t: "Project Flu Season"
   HAH_evt_a02.101.d: "With Willow’s creation of the crystalized version of Tranquility, we were able to fashion a sort of pill for the drug. This new pill form could be passed off as a sort of flu prevention medication to the ponies of Hollow Shades. If we do that then the inquisition will get all of the test results they will ever need."
   HAH_evt_a02.101.a: "Excellent"
 HAH_S10B: "Let The Testing Begin"
  HAH_S10B_desc: "The tests are underway and the first round of pills are being sent out as I speak. Within the next coming days we should learn how Tranquility acts in mass."
  HAH_evt_a02.102.t: "The Tranquil Ponies"
   HAH_evt_a02.102.d: "To my surprise, the plan went through with little to no issues. Yes there were a few hiccups, but overall it went swimmingly! We were able to administer the pills of Tranquility to several hundred ponies within Hollow Shades. Seven hundred in total to be exact. All of them took well to the drug, and were showing similar signs as test subjects one, two, three, and five. However, what concerns me is the fact that after about two to three days several of them were asking for more. Had those ponies already become addicted? No, I highly doubt that they would get hooked after just one dose from those pills. Perhaps they want more of the happiness the drug provided them?"
   HAH_evt_a02.102.a: "Success!"
 HAH_S11: "The Inquisition’s Scientists"

   HAH_evt_a02.111.d: "After months of trying to get his old friend away from work, Misty was finally able to have tea with Willow once again. The two of them sat within the town center. Having tea and discussing old times and the future of the Tranquility Project. That is until Misty delivers the news that was given to him by a member of the inquisition a few days ago.\n\n“Willow, the inquisition has greenlit more testing and funding for our project. Hell, they even want to send a few of their own scientists to aid in further development.”\n\nThe earth pony could only smile as he heard Misty’s words. However, his expression changed as Misty continued.\n\n“But they want you away from the project. They say it hurts the look of our overlord if the world knew that an earth pony like you had a hoof in the project.”\n\nWillow sat there speechless, his friend’s words shattering the earth pony’s heart. Had all of his work been for nothing? Was the inquisition going to so easily toss him to the side after all the work he helped Misty do?\n\nWhat would happen next would change that little dominion of House Moon and Star forever."

 HAH_EWS3.0000.d: "Before his friend could even have the chance to say anything further, Willow got up from the table and stormed off. Vanishing into the shadowy streets of Hollow Shades. The stallion could not wrap his head around what he was told. He had been loyally serving Canterlot all this time, and now they just wanted to toss him aside? After everything he has done for the project?"
 HAH_EWS3.0000.a: "Never more..."
 HAH_WS300: "Willow Takes His Stand"
  HAH_WS300_desc: "Backed by a hoof full of bobbies, Willow marches to the factory billowing pink smoke at the edge of town. He knew what he was doing would have consequences, but full of so much anger and hatred, he did not care. He would not let anyone replace him on this project. Even if it meant he had to march over Misty to keep it from happening."
  HAH_EWS3.0001.t: "Storming of the Factory"
   HAH_EWS3.0001.d: "As Misty and the Canterlot scientists worked on the latest batch of Tranquility, Willow and his bobbies burst into the factory. As his bobbies dealt with the small amount of guard ponies in the way, Willow made his way onto the factory floor. He barged his way into the lab and drew an old pistol from his robes.\n\n§6#§! "I am sorry. But I have to ask you all to surrender this factory and the Tranquility to me."\n\nHearing this coming from a familiar voice, Misty turned around and was greeted with a terrifying sight. The pony he had considered his best friend was waving a gun around at ponies on the factory floor. The other ponies in the room looked on in shock as the Earth pony swayed his aim back and forth at all of them. Misty began to panic calling out to his old friend.\n\n§3#§! "Willow stop this. You are going to get yourself killed!"\n\nWillow shouted back, pointing the gun towards Misty a few times as he spoke.\n\n§6#§! "Misty. I am not going to let anyone replace me. I have worked too damn hard on this project with you to be tossed aside. If it was not for me you probably never would have finished the mixture in the first place. And if you are too much of a coward to take a stand against these bastards, even if it is for me... Then I have no choice.""
   HAH_EWS3.0001.a: "Proceed..."
  HAH_EWS3.0002.t: "$HAH_EWS3.0001.t$"
   HAH_EWS3.0002.d: "Misty looked on in horror as tears began to well up in his eyes. Was his friend really doing this? This had to be a nightmare right? It was then the earth pony’s bobbies came rushing into the room and stood beside him. Outmanned and with no real way to fight back, Misty and the scientists surrendered themselves and the factory to Willow. The bobbies would soon round them all up while Willow holstered his gun. With tears flooding from his eyes, Misty would cry out to Willow.\n\n§3#§! "You bastard! You traitorous bastard! Why would you do this to me? Why would you do this to us!?"\n\nHearing those words Willow gave the order to have them all transported to the town’s jail house. Once they were gone and he was alone within the factory, a few tears of his own fell to the floor."

   HAH_EWS3.0101.d: "Acting Quickly, Willow began making moves to secure the loyalty of the rest of the bobbies. Once he had done that, he then began persuading the townsponies to his side. Which all things considered was not that hard. With the aid of Tranquility it did not take much to convince them. However, in the grand scheme of it all, those were the easy tasks. Now comes the much more difficult ones. It would not be long before Canterlot and the Inquisition discovered what he had done. He needed to act swiftly before they could brand him a traitor and take actions against him. When it comes to complicated matters like this he really wished that he still had Misty by his side to help come up with a plan. Running out of time and ideas, he finally decided on a plan sparked out of desperation. He would send Misty and the scientists back to Canterlot along with a letter. He quickly gathered the materials and began writing:\n\n"I Willow Branch have taken control of Hollow Shades, the populace, and The factory where project Tranquility is produced. I am the one who helped develop it with Misty and got it working. I am well aware that the actions I have taken are brash, but I have taken these actions to preserve the passion and progress of the project. I did not want to see my work sullied, claimed, or dabbled with by some Canterlot scientist who has never even heard of this town before. I swear my loyalty to Canterlot and will continue to provide the quotas put in place, and to provide all continued research data on the Tranquility project going forward.""

As they left though, Misty would not even look at Willow. The earth pony could see the tears in his old friend's eyes. He knew though that there was nothing that he could say or do that would make things better. So, Willow watched as the group vanished into the forests around the town. He waved goodbye to Misty one last time, gently saying the words,\n\n§6#§! "I am sorry Misty - so very sorry, but I had no choice. You may never forgive me and that is ok. I just hope that one day we may meet again and we can forget about what this dark place has done to us.""

   HAH_EWS3.0103.d: "I have received word that the forces of the Inquisition have blockaded all of the roads leading out of town since Misty and the scientists were sent away. No pony is allowed to come in, no pony can get out. It seems that the only way we have out of this land to trade is the rivers. That is if we can sneak boats up the rivers.  Hopefully with time they will realize that I am no threat to them or that status quo. Until that day comes all I can do is do things that show my loyalty."

He did not understand, why did they not just march on town?  What was stopping them?\n\n§0#§! "They are not going to march on this town you know. Not yet at least."\n\nA voice called out to Willow. Snapping him out of the almost fear-like trance he was in. He looked to the sound of the voice and saw Morning Dew walking up next to him.\n\n§0#§! "You are lucky that in all of your idiotic and brash actions choices you made as of recent sending me with that group back to Canterlot was not one of them. You see those legionaries out there will not march on this land as long as I am still here within this town. Those road blockades, those are only the start what Canterlot will do to make sure foolish little colts like you know your place."\n\nMorning Dew would let out a small chuckle before turning and heading back to the roof entrance. However, he would stop at the door and turn back to Willow.\n\n§0#§! "Now I would advise that you leave this roof before you fall. After all, now that you are in charge you have to make sure the quotas are met. Chop chop earthy."\n\nWith that the unicorn would vanish through the door back into the library.

   HAH_evt_a03w.031.d: "A few days after the war games a large group of inquisitorial legionaries marched into town. An announcement was made by the group's commander to myself and the rest of the town that the roads were open once again, and that the sanctions were lifted. However, She also stated that Canterlot had sent them to keep a much closer eye on me and every pony within the town.

Whether it be because they were called back to Canterlot, felt like they carried out their holy orders, or they just got bored no one can say. I am just glad that they finally left this town.  As they marched out of Hollow Shades singing their twisted holy hems, Willow found himself talking to a bobby standing next to him.\n\n“Look at what they have left in their wake. Nothing but fear, bloodshed, and a small mountain of bodies. What did those ponies do to deserve their wrath beyond merely existing? Did all of them die merely over me taking power? We best increase the production of Tranquility for a while. The ponies in this town are going to need it after these past few months."

   HAH_EWS3.0401.d: "Accompanied by a few bobbies, Willow began the long journey to Canterlot. Once they got there however, the group stood out like a sore hoof. The sight of Willow and his group of tall, masked police ponies caught many eyes within the city. Whispers and dirty looks followed behind them as the city watched the 5 masked ponies travel to the gathering.\n\nOnce they had reached the place, Willow could see that it was a lavash party hosted within a manor. They were greeted at the door with distrust from the guards, but when he presented his papers and badge they begrudgingly let them in. As they entered Willow could feel all of the eyes within the manor drift towards them. They were surrounded by the elites of the city and a few of the highest ranking members of the Inquisition. All dining on the finest of foods and drinks the nation had to offer. Seeing this Willow began to feel extremely uncomfortable and wanted to turn right back around and leave. Then he heard a voice call out to him.\n\n“Ah so this is the new pony in charge of that quaint little back water out east I take it? Quite the entourage you have there.”\nA strange unicorn says while approaching Willow. The old boney mare wore a black dress, had a black and white mane, and a smile comparable to a snake who spotted a mouse. She looked over Willow and his guards for a moment before speaking again.\n\n“An Earth pony huh? They will let anyone lead one of our puppets anymore won't they…?  Tell me, which one of those dirty little towns on the outskirts did they find you in?”\nThe mare asked before taking a slow drag from a cigarette. Willow narrowed his eyes a bit before speaking up.\n“I am from Canterlot actually… I was born and raised here just outside the city walls”\nHearing this the mare looked a little shocked and puzzled for a moment before exhaling a sickly green smoke from her nose.\n“Well darling, feel free to indulge yourself while you are here… You are one of us now after all. By the way, if you ever want to update the way your escorts look I have an eye for making this fabulous darling. Just ask for Lady DeeVill when you're in town again some time.”\n\nShe says before walking off, leaving Willow and his bobbies to partake in the party. Eventually The party would begin to come to an end as ponies began to leave. As Willow and his bobbies left, the stallion felt as if he was at least a little successful in his efforts to build some bridges."

Perhaps they can give me something useful."
