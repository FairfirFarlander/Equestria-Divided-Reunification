###National Focuses###
##Storyline Tree - Act 1##
HAH_S00: "Under Their Domain"
 HAH_S00_desc: "Hollow Shades was such a backwater little town, but now that I am at the helm perhaps something can finally be done with this place. Canterlot bestowed me with this power and I intend to make sure I show my gratitude. Oh it is like my dreams as a colt where I was the ruler of my own little kingdom! But enough fawning and merry making, it is time that I get to work. A time for play can come later."
 HAH_evt_a01.001.t: "Rules of Dominion"
 HAH_evt_a01.001.d: "When Canterlot put me in charge of this little back water they made sure to stress just how important it was that I kept up with demand. Now normally that would be a simple little thing to do, but alas the former caretaker of this place was not very keen on those demands. Instead, only continuing the punishment of the ponies who live here. Could he not see that one can meet demand and deal out punishment? Before I can properly begin the little thing I was sent here to do, I must meet these demands. They even sent me a few lovely groups of soldiers to help make sure that they are met. How nice of them."
 HAH_evt_a01.001.a: "What a Lovely Day in Hollow Shades."
 HAH_evt_C-FF_W-TY.r: "§gCredits§!: §LWritten§! by §CTiviyl§!, §LCoded§! by §CFairfir§!."
 HAH_S01A: "A Demand for Timber and Stone"
 HAH_S01A_desc: "The engineers within Canterlot can not build without lumber now can they? It seems that although my predecessor was at least meeting that Quota, he was very sloppy about doing so. With only a little time, zoning, and organization shipments of lumber will start being sent up in a much more timely manner."
 HAH_S01B: "Grain Quotas"
 HAH_S01B_desc: "Those ponies in Canterlot love both their parties and their armies, but you can have neither without the proper amount of grain. This land has good soil for where it is and those back in Canterlot know that. I can not promise mountains of the stuff, but I can at least promise enough to help out."
 HAH_S01C: "A Quota for Steel"
 HAH_S01C_desc: "Canterlot seems to be always in need of steel these days and the steel mills just can not seem to keep up. An order was sent out from the head unicorn herself a while ago that all the outer territories should be producing steel. Sadly under the old caretaker this place has yet to start any meaningful production. Thankfully he at least put the ground work in place. There is an unfinished steel mill within town. It should take no time at all to get up and running."
 HAH_S02: "Now On to Business"
 HAH_S02_desc: "Now with the demands of Canterlot satisfied for the time being, I can begin to work on what I was sent to this backwater to do."
 HAH_evt_a01.021.t: "Back to Business"
  HAH_evt_a01.021.d: "Misty Whisps Sat within the town’s old library. Pondering over a few over a few thoughts aloud as he gazed into a mirror. With the demands and quotas met for the time being, it is time that I begin my actual work. I came to the inquisition with the little proposal of a sort of wonder drug. They seemed interested enough to provide me with a little funding and a place to do my research. In return they were expecting me to produce some kind of results within the year. Well I did just that, I was able to produce a little concoction like I promised them. However, when I was sent out here to test it, the carriage carrying the stuff crashed into a river. The entire batch that I had made lost because of some reckless driver. Does the inquisition care though? Hell no, they do not. All they want is the results. If I am going to have any chance of making a new batch and start the testing process I am going to need a few things. I am going to need my equipment shipped here, a supply of the proper ingredients, and my old friend brought here to help me. All of this will take time. Time that I have little of. In the meantime I am going to have to begin working on other little schemes to keep the inquisition and the rest of Canterlot off of my back."

  HAH_evt_a01.021.h: "§gDebug§!: §RDeactivate§! §YBack to Business§! decisions category."
 HAH_evt_a01.022.t: "The Luxuries of The Capital"
  HAH_evt_a01.022.d: "I would be lying to myself if I did not admit that I greatly miss the luxuries afforded to me back in the capital. Libraries, fine food, the arts, and other grandeur are all treasures afforded to any unicorn under the banner of Moon and Star. However out here, those things are how do you say non existent here. I bet with a few little projects the unicorns here will become more welcoming to their new status in life under Canterlot. More importantly it should also keep the inquisition happy. They always seem to love seeing fellow unicorns realizing their new positions."
  HAH_evt_a01.022.a: ""
  HAH_evt_a01.022.h: "§gDebug§!: §RRevert§! event effects."
 HAH_D03A: "A Grander Library"
 HAH_D03A_desc: "If there is one thing that this small town needs is books, books, and more books! Now there is a small library here in town, but it is nothing like those you would find back in the capital. Though I can not commission such grand works here, what I can do is have more texts shipped in and expand the library here. It will take a little time, but I am more then sure it will be worth it"
 HAH_D03B: "The Glory of the Theatre"
 HAH_D03B_desc: "Who does not love the arts? Especially when it is the art of the theater. A simple amphitheater would take little time to construct, and would bring some much needed culture to the unicorns around here. Not only that, but perhaps it could also be used to host little lectures of knowledge and mythics. Oh Misty, you are a genius!"
 HAH_evt_a01.032.t: "Bread and Circuses"
  HAH_evt_a01.032.d: "You unlocked Bread and Circuses. Yaaay!"
  HAH_evt_a01.032.a: "Yatta!"
  HAH_evt_a01.032.h: "§gDebug§!: §RDeactivate§! §YBread and Circuses§! decisions."
 HAH_D03C: "Statues to Their Gods"
 HAH_D03C_desc: "One thing I know for sure will keep the inquisitors off of my back for a while will be to build some kind of temple or shrine to the lost princesses. Who knows maybe it will even raise some morale around here to see them in some kind form again. I will commission a statue maker back in Canterlot to build some statues and then to build a shrine for each of them."
 HAH_D03D: "Whispering Wisp Manner"
 HAH_D03D_desc: "There is a rather old and dashing looking house on the outskirts of the town. It requires a lot of work, but I can see it becoming quite a lovely manor for myself. I could host waltzes, parties, and more from within a grand ballroom. Just like the ones back home in Canterlot. Surely it would raise the spirits of those here. Who knows it may also draw some of my old friends from Canterlot here as well."
 HAH_evt_a01.036.t: "A Ball"
  HAH_evt_a01.036.d: "No Chains."
  HAH_evt_a01.036.a: "§RAssasinate§! §YBall and Chain§!"
 HAH_S04A: "Bubble Bubble"
 HAH_S04A_desc: "Now that everything is in place we can begin the process of brewing the new batch. However it will take time for me and Willow to brew up another batch. I just hope that we can get a working batch in time. We will also need a place to safely mess with these chemicals."
 HAH_evt_a01.041.t: "Production Begins"
  HAH_evt_a01.041.d: "A dash of lithium, a few sprigs of lavender, and a hoof full of other things is what is required to make this concoction. Things that are not easy to come by in this world anymore. Thankfully through some of my old connections in Canterlot I have been able to get my hooves on a little bit of each. Just enough to make a few batches to begin the testing. What is even better is the fact that we actually found an old factory on the outskirts of town that can be used to hide away all of the equipment and ingredients. One of the serfs mentioned it was some kind of old toy factory or something before the great division. Hopefully none of these hoof dragging legionnaires gets an idea to fiddle with any of this stuff and cause anymore delays. I do not think the inquisition will take kindly to any more delays no matter what they are."
  HAH_evt_a01.041.a: "Hark!"
 HAH_S04B: "Toil and Trouble"
 HAH_S04B_desc: "With the new batch completed, we can finally begin testing. I will have the legionaries round up a few of the serfs from the outer parts of the region. No one should raise an eyebrow if somepony goes missing there."
 HAH_evt_a01.042.t: "A Bad Batch"
  HAH_evt_a01.042.d: "No, no, no! The testing could not have gone worse. We got five ponies together and gave them each an injection of the concoction. Test subjects one and two survived the testing process for lack of a better term. It stayed in their systems for about three days before it wore off. However, during those three days it was noted that they were rather violent. Test subjects 3 and 5 both went mad around the second day. Saying that it felt like everything was watching them with soulless, deminted eyes. Needless to say they both had gone mad. And as for test subject 4, she died from her heart exploding. It seems like her heart could not handle it. Blast it all to hell! The inquisition is demanding results after all of the money and time they have given me, and what do I have to show for it?! Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\nWillow Believes that he may have some kind of solution. A different mixture of measurements and the inclusion of a rather odd ingredient. I just hope that his little idea works. If it does not, I fear that my lovely coat collar may be getting stained red."
  HAH_evt_a01.042.a: "But What of Cador?"
 HAH_S05: "Willow's Solution"
 HAH_S05_desc: "After working for days my dear friend and I may have finally brewed a miracle. Tonight we are bringing back those same four test subjects as before and testing this stuff out."
 HAH_evt_a01.051.t: "Willow's Solution"
  HAH_evt_a01.051.d: "We were actually able to do it! Or well in a way we did it I guess. The new concoction actually worked. Not as I had planned, but worked nonetheless! Test subjects one and two from before responded to this new batch rather well. Both were less violent during the three days of testing, and both responded well to suggestions. Test subjects three and five from before responded just as well. Both noted that they could no longer see or feel all of those eyes watching them. However, I did note that we only got it working in a way. Yes we accomplished the goal, but all four test subjects had this rather eery joyfulness to them while the concoction was in their systems.\n\nThat little side effect matters little though. What does matter however is the fact that we are onto something and I finally have findings to report to the inquisition. Perhaps now they will get off of my case. All this being said, I can not thank Willow enough for what he has done these past few months. I decided that since he is the one who perfected it, he should be the one to name it. That silly fool suggested to name it Tranquility. I would say it is silly, but with the odd happiness the test subjects had during testing I find it oddly fitting."
   HAH_evt_a01.051.a: "Excellent!"
   HAH_evt_a01.051.h: ""
##Storyline Tree - Act 2##
HAH_S06A: "An Unforseen Issue"
 HAH_S06A: "When we sent the test subjects back to their villages with tranquility in their systems, we had a few legionaries tail them just to keep me informed about how they acted. As it turns out what happened was rather unpleasant."
 HAH_evt_a02.061.t: "The Attack"
  HAH_evt_a02.061.d: "While returning back to their abodes three out of the four test subjects displayed rather joyful behavior, that is until three of them came across some pony who looked rather upset. Test subject three was noted to have started vehemently questioning why the other pony was so unhappy. Insisting that they should be smiling like he was. Eventually aftering getting frustrated with the random pony he went on back to his cottage.\n\nTest subjects one and two however were a much different story. While on their way back to wherever it was they called home they came across a crying stallion next to a well. They did the same as number three when he came across a rather unhappy pony. Questioning and badgering him about why his was not smiling. However, what happened next was different, and much more admittedly tragic. The stallion tried to get away from the two test subjects, but was stopped by them and then was viciously beaten by the two of them until the legionaries tailing them stepped in.\n\nBoth I and Willow are confused by what happened today, and can not come up with an explanation as to why neither of us or the legionaries sent with them were not attacked or confronted like that. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact our faces could not be seen by them? Could it be that those who are on tranquility can not stand the sight of someone who is not happy like they are? This will take time to further understand."
  HAH_evt_a02.061.a: "Hmmm..."
 HAH_S06B: "To Protect Those Who Are Yet to be Tested On"
  HAH_S06B_desc: "What happened with those three test subjects is still greatly bugging me. We can not proceed with any more testing until we discover if the theory is true!"
  HAH_evt_a02.062.t: "Misty’s Solution"
   HAH_evt_a02.062.d: "Misty and Willow were sitting within the old factory having tea. Trying their best to devise a plan of some kind to test their theories about why the test subjects reacted so strangely to the ponies who looked sad. After much deliberation and thought, Misty would spring up in exclamation. “I have it! We could throw a grand masquerade! We will pawn it off as a sort of three days of rest and festivities. It will provide us with the understanding we need of those on tranquility, but also provide a sort of uplift to the rest of the region. Keeping the serfs happy and in check. Canterlot and the inquisition will think that we have gone mad, but to tarderous with them, we could kill two birds with one stone!” Willow could only smile and nod along in agreement to his old friend’s idea. Willow knew that Misty could be foolish and even overly ambitious a lot of the time. However, when it came to matters such as this, he could not think of any brighter unicorn to dream up solutions."
   HAH_evt_a02.062.a: "Stupendous"
 HAH_S07A: "The Masks"
  HAH_S07A_desc: "We can not have a grand masquerade without masks, and I know a few artists back in Canterlot who would love the business. It would have to be a simple mask to keep it cheap, but also one that has a smile built into it so we can actually study our theory."
  HAH_evt_a02.071.t: "The Masks"
   HAH_evt_a02.071.d: "The masks finally arrived in the river port today, and dear sisters they are unsettling. The porcelain white masks all fit what I had asked the artists to make. Each of them were just a little different here and there, but all had the same main features. The raised cheeks and shape of the eyes together would make the wearer look like they were smiling. Willow seems to think that they are not that bad, and will work just fine to test the theory we have. Still though, I can not help but be just a little unsettled by the look of the things."
   HAH_evt_a02.071.a: ""
 HAH_S07B: "The Breads"
  HAH_S07A_desc: "Although it will be a tough sell, I could try and see if the other serf states around me could spare us some wheat. Say it is to ease the burdens of a bad harvest or something. They will not like sharing, but it will give us the grain we need."
 HAH_S07C: "The Wine"
  HAH_S07A_desc: "There was an old beekeeping operation that was in operation here before the division. In more recent times however, it is a shadow of its former glory. The earthy who ran it was replaced by a unicorn who had no idea what she was doing after Hollow Shade’s surrender. I bet with a little work and string pulling I could get that place working again and get the honey flowing again. If I can do that then we can get honey wine for the masquerade!"
