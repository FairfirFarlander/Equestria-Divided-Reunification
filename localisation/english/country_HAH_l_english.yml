##Storyline Tree##
HAH_S00:"Under Their Domain"
 HAH_S00_desc:"Hollow Shades was such a backwater little town, but now that I am at the helm perhaps something can finally be done with this place. Canterlot bestowed me with this power and I intend to make sure I show my gratitude. Oh it is like my dreams as a colt where I was the ruler of my own little kingdom! But enough fawning and merry making, it is time that I get to work. A time for play can come later."
 HAH_evt_a01.001.t:"Rules of Dominion"
  HAH_evt_a01.001.d:"When Canterlot put me in charge of this little back water they made sure to stress just how important it was that I kept up with demand. Now normally that would be a simple little thing to do, but alas the former caretaker of this place was not very keen on those demands. Instead, only continuing the punishment of the ponies who live here. Could he not see that one can meet demand and deal out punishment? Before I can properly begin the little thing I was sent here to do, I must meet these demands. They even sent me a few lovely groups of soldiers to help make sure that they are met. How nice of them."
  HAH_evt_a01.001.a:"What a Lovely Day in Hollow Shades."
  HAH_evt_C-FF_W-TY.r:"§gCredits§!: §LWritten§! by §CTiviyl§!, §LCoded§! by §CFairfir§!."
 HAH_S01A:"A Demand for Timber and Stone"
  HAH_S01A_desc:"The engineers within Canterlot can not build without lumber now can they? It seems that although my predecessor was at least meeting that Quota, he was very sloppy about doing so. With only a little time, zoning, and organization shipments of lumber will start being sent up in a much more timely manner."
 HAH_S01B:"Grain Quotas"
  HAH_S01B_desc:"Those ponies in Canterlot love both their parties and their armies, but you can have neither without the proper amount of grain. This land has good soil for where it is and those back in Canterlot know that. I can not promise mountains of the stuff, but I can at least promise enough to help out."
 HAH_S01C:"A Quota for Steel"
  HAH_S01C_desc:"Canterlot seems to be always in need of steel these days and the steel mills just can not seem to keep up. An order was sent out from the head unicorn herself a while ago that all the outer territories should be producing steel. Sadly under the old caretaker this place has yet to start any meaningful production. Thankfully he at least put the ground work in place. There is an unfinished steel mill within town. It should take no time at all to get up and running."
 HAH_S02:"Now On to Business"
  HAH_S02_desc:"Now with the demands of Canterlot satisfied for the time being, I can begin to work on what I was sent to this backwater to do."
  HAH_evt_a01.021.t:"Back to Business"
   HAH_evt_a01.021.d:"Misty Whisps Sat within the town’s old library.  Pondering over a few over a few thoughts aloud as he gazed into a mirror. With the demands and quotas met for the time being, it is time that I begin my actual work. I came to the inquisition with the little proposal of a sort of wonder drug. They seemed interested enough to provide me with a little funding and a place to do my research. In return they were expecting me to produce some kind of results within the year. Well I did just that, I was able to produce a little concoction like I promised them. However, when I was sent out here to test it, the carriage carrying the stuff crashed into a river. The entire batch that I had made lost because of some reckless driver.  Does the inquisition care though? Hell no, they do not. All they want is the results. If I am going to have any chance of making a new batch and start the testing process I am going to need a few things. I am going to need my equipment shipped here, a supply of the proper ingredients, and my old friend brought here to help me. All of this will take time. Time that I have little of. In the meantime I am going to have to begin working on other little schemes to keep the inquisition and the rest of Canterlot off of my back."

  HAH_evt_a01.022.t:"The Luxuries of The Capital"
   HAH_evt_a01.022.d:"I would be lying to myself if I did not admit that I greatly miss the luxuries afforded to me back in the capital. Libraries, fine food, the arts, and other grandeur are all treasures afforded to any unicorn under the banner of Moon and Star. However out here, those things are how do you say non existent here. I bet with a few little projects the unicorns here will become more welcoming to their new status in life under Canterlot. More importantly it should also keep the inquisition happy. They always seem to love seeing fellow unicorns realizing their new positions."

 HAH_D03A:"A Grander Library"
  HAH_D03A_desc:"If there is one thing that this small town needs is books, books, and more books! Now there is a small library here in town, but it is nothing like those you would find back in the capital. Though I can not commission such grand works here, what I can do is have more texts shipped in and expand the library here. It will take a little time, but I am more then sure it will be worth it"
 HAH_D03B:"The Glory of the Theatre"
  HAH_D03B_desc:"Who does not love the arts? Especially when it is the art of the theater. A simple amphitheater would take little time to construct, and would bring some much needed culture to the unicorns around here. Not only that, but perhaps it could also be used to host little lectures of knowledge and mythics. Oh Misty, you are a genius!"
  HAH_evt_a01.032.t:"Bread and Circuses"
   HAH_evt_a01.032.d:"You unlocked Bread and Circuses. Yaaay!"
   HAH_evt_a01.032.a:"Yatta!"

 HAH_D03C:"Statues to Their Gods"
  HAH_D03C_desc:"One thing I know for sure will keep the inquisitors off of my back for a while will be to build some kind of temple or shrine to the lost princesses. Who knows maybe it will even raise some morale around here to see them in some kind form again. I will commission a statue maker back in Canterlot to build some statues and then to build a shrine for each of them."
 HAH_D03D:"Whispering Wisp Manner"
  HAH_D03D_desc:"There is a rather old and dashing looking house on the outskirts of the town. It requires a lot of work, but I can see it becoming quite a lovely manor for myself. I could host waltzes, parties, and more from within a grand ballroom. Just like the ones back home in Canterlot. Surely it would raise the spirits of those here. Who knows it may also draw some of my old friends from Canterlot here as well."
  HAH_evt_a01.035.t:"A Ball"
   HAH_evt_a01.035.d:"No Chains."
   HAH_evt_a01.035.a:"§RAssasinate§! §YBall and Chain§!"
 HAH_S04:"Bubble Bubble"
  HAH_S04_desc:"Now that everything is in place we can begin the process of brewing the new batch. However it will take time for me and Willow to brew up another batch. I just hope that we can get a working batch in time. We will also need a place to safely mess with these chemicals."
