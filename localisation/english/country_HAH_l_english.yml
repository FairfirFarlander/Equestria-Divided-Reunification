###National Focuses###
##Storyline Tree - Act 1##
HAH_S00: "Under Their Domain"
 HAH_S00_desc: "Hollow Shades is such a backwater little town, but now that I am at the helm perhaps something can finally be done with this place. Canterlot bestowed me with this power and I intend to make sure I show my gratitude. Oh it is like my dreams as a colt where I was the ruler of my own little kingdom! But enough fawning and merry making, it is time that I get to work. A time for play can come later."
 HAH_ES1.0001.t: "Rules of Dominion"
 HAH_ES1.0001.d: "When Canterlot put me in charge of this little back water they made sure to stress just how important it was that I kept up with demand. Now normally that would be a simple little thing to do, but alas the former caretaker of this place was not very keen on those demands; instead, only continuing the punishment of the ponies who live here. Could he not see that one can meet demand and deal out punishment? Before I can properly begin the little thing I was sent here to do, I must meet these demands. They even sent me a lovely group of soldiers to help make sure that they are met. How nice of them."
 HAH_ES1.0001.a: "What a lovely day in Hollow Shades."
  HAH_ES1.0001.a_tooltip: "At the request of the §2Equestrian House of Lords§!, §1Prince-Consort Shining Armor§! has sent us a §YLegionary Detachment§!.\n§RThis division and it's template are locked§!."
 HAH_evt_C-FF_W-TY.r: "§gCredits§!: §LWritten§! by §CTiviyl§!, §LCoded§! by §CFairfir§!."
 HAH_S01A: "A Demand for Timber and Stone"
 HAH_S01A_desc: "The engineers within Canterlot can not build without lumber now can they? It seems that although my predecessor was at least meeting that quota, he was very sloppy about doing so. With only a little time, zoning, and organization shipments of lumber will start being sent up in a much more timely manner."
 HAH_S01B: "Grain Quotas"
 HAH_S01B_desc: "Those ponies in Canterlot love both their parties and their armies, but you can have neither without the proper amount of grain. This land has good soil for where it is and those back in Canterlot know that. I can not promise mountains of the stuff, but I can at least promise enough to help out."
 HAH_S01C: "A Quota for Steel"
 HAH_S01C_desc: "Canterlot seems to be always in need of steel these days and the steel mills just can not seem to keep up. An order was sent out from the head unicorn herself a while ago that all the outer territories should be producing steel. Sadly under the old caretaker this place has yet to start any meaningful production. Thankfully there is an unfinished steel mill within town. It should take no time at all to get up and running."
 HAH_S02: "Now On to Business"
 HAH_S02_desc: "Now with the demands of Canterlot satisfied for the time being, I can begin to work on what I was sent to this backwater to do."
 HAH_ES1.0201.t: "Back to Business"
  HAH_ES1.0201.d: "Misty Whisps Sat within the town’s old library. Pondering over a few over a few thoughts aloud as he gazed into a mirror.\n\nWith the demands and quotas met for the time being, it is time that I begin my actual work. I came to the inquisition with the little proposal of a sort of wonder drug. They seemed interested enough to provide me with a little funding and a place to do my research. In return they were expecting me to produce some kind of results within the year. Well I did just that, I was able to produce a little concoction like I promised them. However, when I was sent out here to test it, the carriage carrying the stuff crashed into a river. The entire batch that I had made lost because of some reckless driver. Does the inquisition care though? Hell no, they do not. All they want is the results.\n\nIf I am going to have any chance of making a new batch and start the testing process I am going to need a few things. I am going to need my equipment shipped here, a supply of the proper ingredients, and my old friend brought here to help me. All of this will take time. Time that I have little of. In the meantime I am going to have to begin working on other little schemes to keep the inquisition and the rest of Canterlot off of my back."

 HAH_ES1.0202.t: "The Luxuries of The Capital"
  HAH_ES1.0202.d: "I would be lying to myself if I did not admit that I greatly miss the luxuries afforded to me back in the capital. Libraries, fine food, the arts, and other grandeur are all treasures afforded to any unicorn under the banner of Moon and Star. However out here, those things are how do you say non existent here. I bet with a few little projects the unicorns here will become more welcoming to their new status in life under Canterlot. More importantly it should also keep the inquisition happy. They always seem to love seeing fellow unicorns realizing their new positions."

  HAH_ES1.0202.h: "§gDebug§!: §RRevert§! event effects."
 HAH_D03A: "A Grander Library"
 HAH_D03A_desc: "If there is one thing that this small town needs it is books, books, and more books! Now there is a small library here in town, but it is nothing like those you would find back in the capital. Though I can not commission such grand works here, what I can do is have more texts shipped in and expand the library here. It will take a little time, but I am more then sure it will be worth it."
 HAH_D03B: "The Glory of the Theatre"
 HAH_D03B_desc: "Who does not love the arts? Especially when it is the art of the theater. A simple amphitheater would take little time to construct, and would bring some much needed culture to the unicorns around here. Not only that, but perhaps it could also be used to host little lectures of knowledge and mythics. Oh Misty, you are a genius!"
 HAH_ES1.0302.t: "The Patronage of the Arts"
  HAH_ES1.0302.d: "Within days of the amphitheater's completion, word of mouth had brought the curiosity of several passersby. Many among them sought to experience what it would offer, plying their trades at opportunity. Day by day a community of storytellers began to establish itself, sharing their knowledge of folklore and legend. The most oft of such would be Clover the Clever and Starswirl the Bearded. Others would enter such circles in time. The locals have begun work to organize festivals around such events. With a little bit of funding the bread and circuses may yet improve the usual dour mood of Hollow Shade's citizens."
  HAH_ES1.0302.a: "If music be the food of love play on."
  HAH_ES1.0302.h: "§gDebug§!: §RDeactivate§! §YBread and Circuses§! decisions."
 HAH_D03C: "Statues to Their Gods"
 HAH_D03C_desc: "One thing I know for sure will keep the inquisitors off of my back for a while will be to build some kind of temple or shrine to the lost princesses. Who knows maybe it will even raise some morale around here to see them in some kind form again. I will commission a statue maker back in Canterlot to build some statues and then to build a shrine for each of them."
 HAH_D03D: "Whispering Wisp Manor"
 HAH_D03D_desc: "There is a rather old and dashing looking house on the outskirts of the town. It requires a lot of work, but I can see it becoming quite a lovely manor for myself. I could host waltzes, parties, and more from within a grand ballroom. Just like the ones back home in Canterlot. Surely it would raise the spirits of those here. Who knows it may also draw some of my old friends from Canterlot here as well."
 HAH_ES1.0305.t: "An Informal Attire"
  HAH_ES1.0305.d: "After weeks of restoration and renovations, the newly christiened Whispering Wisp Manor was completed."
  HAH_ES1.0305.a: "§RAssasinate§! §YBall and Chain§!"
 HAH_S04A: "Bubble Bubble"
 HAH_S04A_desc: "Now that everything is in place we can begin the process of brewing the new batch. However it will take time for me and Willow to brew up another batch. I just hope that we can get a working batch in time. We will also need a place to safely mess with these chemicals."
 HAH_ES1.0401.t: "Production Begins"
  HAH_ES1.0401.d: "A dash of lithium, a few sprigs of lavender, and a hoof full of other things is what is required to make this concoction. Things that are not easy to come by in this world anymore. Thankfully through some of my old connections in Canterlot I have been able to get my hooves on a little bit of each. Just enough to make a few batches to begin the testing. What is even better is the fact that we actually found an old factory on the outskirts of town that can be used to hide away all of the equipment and ingredients. One of the serfs mentioned it was some kind of old toy factory or something before the great division. Hopefully none of these hoof dragging legionnaires gets an idea to fiddle with any of this stuff and cause anymore delays. I do not think the inquisition will take kindly to any more delays no matter what they are."
  HAH_ES1.0401.a: "Hark!"
 HAH_S04B: "Toil and Trouble"
 HAH_S04B_desc: "With the new batch completed, we can finally begin testing. I will have the legionaries round up a few of the serfs from the outer parts of the region. No one should raise an eyebrow if somepony goes missing there."
 HAH_ES1.042.t: "A Bad Batch"
  HAH_ES1.042.d: "No, no, no! The testing could not have gone worse. We got five ponies together and gave them each an injection of the concoction. Test subjects one and two survived the testing process for lack of a better term. It stayed in their systems for about three days before it wore off. However, during those three days it was noted that they were rather violent. Test subjects 3 and 5 both went mad around the second day. Saying that it felt like everything was watching them with soulless, deminted eyes. Needless to say they both had gone mad. And as for test subject 4, she died from her heart exploding. It seems like her heart could not handle it. Blast it all to hell! The inquisition is demanding results after all of the money and time they have given me, and what do I have to show for it?! Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\nWillow Believes that he may have some kind of solution. A different mixture of measurements and the inclusion of a rather odd ingredient. I just hope that his little idea works. If it does not, I fear that my lovely coat collar may be getting stained red."
  HAH_ES1.042.a: "But What of Cador?"
 HAH_S05: "Willow's Solution"
 HAH_S05_desc: "After working for days my dear friend and I may have finally brewed a miracle. Tonight we are bringing back those same four test subjects as before and testing this stuff out."
 HAH_ES1.0501.t: "Willow's Solution"
  HAH_ES1.0501.d: "We were actually able to do it! Or well in a way we did it I guess. The new concoction actually worked. Not as I had planned, but worked nonetheless! Test subjects one and two from before responded to this new batch rather well. Both were less violent during the three days of testing, and both responded well to suggestions. Test subjects three and five from before responded just as well. Both noted that they could no longer see or feel all of those eyes watching them. However, I did note that we only got it working in a way. Yes we accomplished the goal, but all four test subjects had this rather eery joyfulness to them while the concoction was in their systems.\n\nThat little side effect matters little though. What does matter however is the fact that we are onto something and I finally have findings to report to the inquisition. Perhaps now they will get off of my case. All this being said, I can not thank Willow enough for what he has done these past few months. I decided that since he is the one who perfected it, he should be the one to name it. That silly fool suggested to name it Tranquility. I would say it is silly, but with the odd happiness the test subjects had during testing I find it oddly fitting."
   HAH_ES1.0501.a: "Excellent!"
   HAH_ES1.0501.h: ""
##Storyline Tree - Act 2##
HAH_S06A: "An Unforseen Issue"
 HAH_S06A_desc: "When we sent the test subjects back to their villages with tranquility in their systems, we had a few legionaries tail them just to keep me informed about how they acted. As it turns out what happened was rather unpleasant."
 HAH_ES2.0601.t: "The Attack"
  HAH_ES2.0601.d: "While returning back to their abodes three out of the four test subjects displayed rather joyful behavior, that is until three of them came across some pony who looked rather upset. Test subject three was noted to have started vehemently questioning why the other pony was so unhappy. Insisting that they should be smiling like he was. Eventually aftering getting frustrated with the random pony he went on back to his cottage.\n\nTest subjects one and two however were a much different story. While on their way back to wherever it was they called home they came across a crying stallion next to a well. They did the same as number three when he came across a rather unhappy pony. Questioning and badgering him about why his was not smiling. However, what happened next was different, and much more admittedly tragic. The stallion tried to get away from the two test subjects, but was stopped by them and then was viciously beaten by the two of them until the legionaries tailing them stepped in.\n\nBoth I and Willow are confused by what happened today, and can not come up with an explanation as to why neither of us or the legionaries sent with them were not attacked or confronted like that. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact our faces could not be seen by them? Could it be that those who are on tranquility can not stand the sight of someone who is not happy like they are? This will take time to further understand."
  HAH_ES2.0601.a: "Hmmm..."
 HAH_S06B: "To Protect Those Who Are Yet to be Tested On"
  HAH_S06B_desc: "What happened with those three test subjects is still greatly bugging me. We can not proceed with any more testing until we discover if the theory is true!"
  HAH_ES2.0602.t: "Misty’s Solution"
   HAH_ES2.0602.d: "Misty and Willow were sitting within the old factory having tea. Trying their best to devise a plan of some kind to test their theories about why the test subjects reacted so strangely to the ponies who looked sad. After much deliberation and thought, Misty would spring up in exclamation. “I have it! We could throw a grand masquerade! We will pawn it off as a sort of three days of rest and festivities. It will provide us with the understanding we need of those on tranquility, but also provide a sort of uplift to the rest of the region. Keeping the serfs happy and in check. Canterlot and the inquisition will think that we have gone mad, but to tarderous with them, we could kill two birds with one stone!” Willow could only smile and nod along in agreement to his old friend’s idea. Willow knew that Misty could be foolish and even overly ambitious a lot of the time. However, when it came to matters such as this, he could not think of any brighter unicorn to dream up solutions."
   HAH_ES2.0602.a: "Stupendous"
 HAH_S07A: "The Masks"
  HAH_S07A_desc: "We can not have a grand masquerade without masks, and I know a few artists back in Canterlot who would love the business. It would have to be a simple mask to keep it cheap, but also one that has a smile built into it so we can actually study our theory."
  HAH_ES2.0701.t: "The Masks"
   HAH_ES2.0701.d: "The masks finally arrived in the river port today, and dear sisters they are unsettling. The porcelain white masks all fit what I had asked the artists to make. Each of them were just a little different here and there, but all had the same main features. The raised cheeks and shape of the eyes together would make the wearer look like they were smiling. Willow seems to think that they are not that bad, and will work just fine to test the theory we have. Still though, I can not help but be just a little unsettled by the look of the things."
   HAH_ES2.0701.a: "Graci"
 HAH_S07B: "The Breads"
  HAH_S07B_desc: "Although it will be a tough sell, I could try and see if the other serf states around me could spare us some wheat. Say it is to ease the burdens of a bad harvest or something. They will not like sharing, but it will give us the grain we need."
  moonstar_seeth_opinion: "They took our grain!"
 HAH_S07C: "The Wine"
  HAH_S07C_desc: "There was an old beekeeping operation that was in operation here before the division. In more recent times however, it is a shadow of its former glory. The earthy who ran it was replaced by a unicorn who had no idea what she was doing after Hollow Shade’s surrender. I bet with a little work and string pulling I could get that place working again and get the honey flowing again. If I can do that then we can get honey wine for the masquerade!"
  HAH_ES2.0704.t: "The Grand Masquerade"
   HAH_ES2.0704.d: "The province of Hollow Shades had begun its grand masquerade. For the next three days all ponies within the region, from the wealthiest unicorn, down to the lowest earth pony serf, were all encouraged to take part in the festivities. Many did just that, however not without looks of distrust and anger from the legionaries and members of the inquisition within the region. Because for those few days, all races would intermingle and gather much like how they did when Equestria was united. For those few short days it almost seems like everypony within these lands are equal.\n\nFearing what may happen, the inquisition had sent extra forces down to the region after hearing such an event was taking place. When the soldiers arrived they had been expecting insurrectionist chaos, but instead found ponies merely enjoying a festival. They were greeted by Misty and told to enjoy the festivities if they so wished while they were in town. A few even joined in on the fun.\n\nMisty was right, his overlord was not pleased with such an event taking place. But he got the data he and Willow wanted. Now further testing can begin."
   HAH_ES2.0704.a: "Hmmm"
   HMS_to_HAH_disapproval: "We Disapprove of Your Actions."
 HAH_S08: "It Is Not Just A Theory"
  HAH_S08_desc: "The theory we had was correct, but how do we even handle this now?!"
  HAH_S08_tooltip: "§GUnlocks the Military and Economic Trees.§!"
  HAH_ES2.0801.t: "Mandated Masks"
   HAH_ES2.0801.d: "While sitting in the factory pouring over the notes he and Willow had taken about the test subjects during the masquerade, Misty could not help but feel conflicted. He and Willow had done it. They had made a concoction that would cut down on chaos and rebellion, but at a cost. Those on the drug would express anger and outrage if they saw a face of anyone who was not happy or contempt. He has little options going forward. After seeing the results from the tests the inquisition has ordered him to increase his testing. One of the inquisitorial staff even wants to know what the test subjects would be like as soldiers.\n\nSeeing little options he has come up with a drastic decision. That being all residents of Hollow Shades must wear the masquerade masks provided to them whenever they leave their homes. Maybe doing that will prevent unnecessary more attacks from those on the drug. However the ponies here will find this new rule rather odd."
   HAH_ES2.0801.a: "It's For Their Own Good"
 HAH_S09A: "Increased Production"
  HAH_S09A_desc: "If we are to increase the amount of testing like the inquisitors wish us to, then we need more space and equipment to brew it. We shall have the serfs begin building onto the old factory while I order more equipment."
 HAH_S09B: "Willow’s Ingredient"
  HAH_S09B_desc: "With a need to increase production comes a need to increase the import or production of ingredients. Everything in the drug can be imported from here or there with ease. Everything apart from the one thing Willow added to the mixture to make it work. That being petals of dried poison joke. We can not really import stuff like that, even with my connections. However, what we can do is start a little farm of the stuff here in Hollow Shades."
  HAH_ES2.0902.t: "Farming Poison Joke"
   HAH_ES2.0902.d: "Well I was wrong, Willow seems to think that we do not need a full farm of the stuff. Instead he believes that all we really need is the amount you would get out of a small greenhouse. So, after the construction of the greenhouse I began working on finding a way to get poison joke plants or seeds here. That is not something Canterlot will easily allow coming through its borders. However, I always found a way in the past to get my hooves on oddities and this will be no different. Perhaps along with the poison joke I could have one of those flower bushes Willow likes so much shipped in as well."
   HAH_ES2.0902.a: "Canterlot doesn't need to know."
 HAH_S09C: "The Bobbies"
  HAH_S09C_desc: "One of those inquisitorial busy bodies wants to know if these test subjects would be useful as a type of soldier. Despite my misgivings about the idea, I have to go through with these tests. I am going to dub these test subjects Bobbies. Now the only issue is finding the test subjects viable enough to make them."
  HAH_ES2.0903.t: "The Bobbies"
   HAH_ES2.0903.d: "After a month of testing, calculations, and experimentation me and Willow were able to give the inquisition what they asked for. A small division of ponies pumped full of Tranquility. We even outfitted them with blue uniforms. Making them look like a police force in a way instead of a militia or military group. However, during the testing Willow had noticed that our drug can be rather addictive to those taking it, and for some the high comes to a thunderous crash once it wears off. Dear sisters, the screams I heard coming from some of them when their high wore off. For now, the inquisition wishes to see how they act while around civilians. So not only do they look like a police force, they basically are one now."
   HAH_ES2.0903.a: "We shall see."
   HAH_bobbies: "The Bobbies"
    HAH_bobbies_desc: ""
 HAH_S09D: "The Constables"
  HAH_S09D_desc: "With the question of a military use of the drug in the air, Willow had suggested a little test for us to put into motion. Subjects one and two from the original tests will be given the rank of Constable within the region's new and experimental militia. To go along with these new roles they will be given uniforms and much higher doses of Tranquility from now on. Hopefully they will do good in such a role."
 HAH_S10A: "Project Flu Season"
  HAH_S10A_desc: "With the increased production of Tranquility we can now begin testing on much larger groups of ponies within Hollow Shades. I have been looking for a way to increase our ability to test Trainquility, and Willow in his never ending brilliance was able to crystalize the drug."
  HAH_ES2.1001.t: "Project Flu Season"
   HAH_ES2.1001.d: "With Willow’s creation of the crystalized version of Tranquility, we were able to fashion a sort of pill for the drug. This new pill form could be passed off as a sort of flu prevention medication to the ponies of Hollow Shades. If we do that then the inquisition will get all of the test results they will ever need."
   HAH_ES2.1001.a: "Excellent"
 HAH_S10B: "Let The Testing Begin"
  HAH_S10B_desc: "The tests are underway and the first round of pills are being sent out as I speak. Within the next coming days we should learn how Tranquility acts in mass."
  HAH_ES2.1002.t: "The Tranquil Ponies"
   HAH_ES2.1002.d: "To my surprise, the plan went through with little to no issues. Yes there were a few hiccups, but overall it went swimmingly! We were able to administer the pills of Tranquility to several hundred ponies within Hollow Shades. Seven hundred in total to be exact. All of them took well to the drug, and were showing similar signs as test subjects one, two, three, and five. However, what concerns me is the fact that after about two to three days several of them were asking for more. Had those ponies already become addicted? No, I highly doubt that they would get hooked after just one dose from those pills. Perhaps they want more of the happiness the drug provided them?"
   HAH_ES2.1002.a: "Success!"
 HAH_S11: "The Inquisition’s Scientists"

Hell, they even want to send a few of their own scientists to aid in further development.”\n\nThe earth pony could only smile as he heard Misty’s words. However, his expression changed as Misty continued.\n\n“But they want you away from the project. They say it hurts the look of our overlord if the world knew that an earth pony like you had a hoof in the project.”\n\nWillow sat there speechless, his friend’s words shattering the earth pony’s heart.

Now comes the much more difficult ones. It would not be long before Canterlot and the Inquisition discovered what he had done. He needed to act swiftly before they could brand him a traitor and take actions against him. When it comes to complicated matters like this he really wished that he still had Misty by his side to help come up with a plan.

Misty had left what was left of his holdings and fortune to Willow. They were here to get some paperwork signed and to inform the earth pony of the news. Willow looked at them shocked and confused. There was no possible way such a thing was possible was it? He read through the papers they wanted signed, and sure enough they were telling the truth. He signed the papers, and with those few strokes of a quill, Willow had become as wealthy as many of the elites back Canterlot.\n\nAfter all that paperwork had been signed, they moved on to the discussions of how the funeral would be handled. They group would talk for hours back and forth about what should be done, how, when, and where. It was soon enough settled however. Misty’s body would be laid to rest not within Canterlot, but on a little hill overlooking Hollow Shades. When questioned why he would not be buried within Canterlot with his family, Willow had a not so simple response.\n\n§6#§!"Misty, although he loved the decadence of Canterlot, always seemed to love the peacefulness that came with being outside the city’s walls. He often came to my small hole in the wall of a home to escape the noise and pressure of it all when we were colts. It would be only fitting then that he gets to rest in a peaceful place like the forests around this little town.""

He looked over every little thing within as his hoof gently clutched the locket around his neck. His mind wandered with memories and thoughts of his old friend. What would Misty want me to do with such wealth? He thought to himself as it almost felt like some pony was walking through the small manner alongside him. After a while Willow would leave the old house seemingly knowing what he should do. He would share a part of the wealth with the ponies of Hollow Shades. He walked back to town. However, he found himself stopping for a moment to look back at the manor. In that moment he could almost swear he saw what looked like a foggy figure Misty standing in the doorway, gently smiling at him. Surely that was not possible right? Nevertheless whether it was real or fake, the earth pony would smile back at the figure before continuing back to town."

  HAH_EWS3.0801.t: "Misty’s Statue"
   HAH_EWS3.0801.d: "Within the month a large crate was carted into the town. The smiling ponies of Hollow Shades gathered around in wonder and curiosity. Outsiders rarely came through the town anymore unless they were Inquisitors from Moon and Star. And those who do never bring such things in tow. More than a little freaked out by the gathering masked masses, the pony pulling the cart unhooked himself from the cart and ran off into the woods. Leaving the growing crowd even more curious. Then Willow approached, escorted through the crowd by two bobbies. Once he was close enough he climbed onto the cart and looked upon the townsponies that surrounded him. Then taking a deep breath, he began to speak to them all.\n\n§6#§! "As you all know… Misty was the great pony who helped give you all this happiness and the ability to smile once again in this dark and blighted world. Ever since the sisters called him home I have been looking for a way to properly honor him. Within this crate is the way I and the rest of you shall honor him."\n\nWillow then opened the crate, and inside was a beautiful statue of Misty made of blue stone. The unicorn’s image had been carved seemingly perfectly into stone. Finally seeing it after all this wait, Willow lowered his head and gently smiled. Tears forming within his eyes while he muttered to himself.\n\n§6#§! "Misty... I know that this is nothing as extravagant as what you would have commissioned, but I hope you can see it. Wherever it is you may be, I hope that you like it..."\n\nLater that day the statue would be raised on the edge of town.  On a quiet and peaceful little hill overlooking the town."

Rarely having spoken to anypony unless there was a need. On this day the inquisitor broke his silence once again. He called for a meeting between him and Willow within the factory. Once Willow had gotten there, Morning Dew would be sitting there waiting for him. Holding a cup of tea with his magic.\n\n§0#§! "Willow, come have a seat. We need to have a very important discussion."\n\nWillow would do as he was told to by the high inquisitor. Taking a seat across from him as Morning Dew’s purple eyes would be staring straight through him.\n\n§0#§! "Now Willow, I am sure you are more than aware now that your kind having any kind of real power or pull is quite unheard of within our society. The fact of the matter is that you should not be in the position you are in and many a pony wants to see you out of it and swinging from your neck. I have helped keep that from happening. If it was not due to the fact that you were keeping up the testing of tranquility that is where you would be, swinging. I have been a patient stallion."\n\nThe unicorn would stop for a moment to take a sip of his tea. Never taking his purple eyes off of Willow for more than a moment."

Building a statue worthy of the sisters to honor a lowly and meek unicorn like Misty. Even going as far as putting the ideas of equality in the minds of the ponies of this town. You naughty, naughty you poor little earthy."\n\nMorning Dew’s mouth would slowly shape into a grin as he sat down his tea cup. Slowly standing up after words and walking over to Willow’s side and placing a hoof on the earth pony’s shoulder.\n\n§0#§! "Willow, you know I have no further choice. I must report back to Canterlot soon with everything that you have done here to betray their good will and graciousness to let you lead, let alone live after what you had done. By morning’s first light, you will be laying dead in a ditch, that stature will be rubble, and this town will be punished for your sins. Like disobedient hounds, the ponies here will be beaten until they learn better, or disposed of if they can not. And every drop of blood spilt here will be because of you."\n\nThe words of the unicorn cut through Willow like a dagger. Drawing a few tears from his eyes. Seeing this, Morning would shake his head and lift Willow's chin to make the earth pony look into his eyes.\n\n§0#§! "Now, no need for such tears. Look at it like this.

He lunged for Morning Dew and tackled him to the floor. Catching the unicorn off guard completely. The two would find themselves struggling against the old stone floors of the factory for quite some time. Willow would scream in a rage and swing down at the unicorn with his hooves. Connecting blow after bone cracking blow. Morning Dew tried desperately to fight back. Pulling a knife from his belt with magic and trying to stab Willow with it. However, that was when Willow’s hoof would connect with the unicorn’s horn, snapping it. The blade would fall to the floor as Morning screamed out in pain. Loud enough to be heard outside the building.\n\nHearing the scream, two bobbies rushed into the factory. Ready to meet whatever was inside. That is until they came across the grizzly sight within. Willow stood over the inquisitor’s body, panting, bruised, and eyes still filled with anger. Unsure as to what to do or who’s side to take, one of them spoke out to Willow.\n\n§t#§! "Uh...

Dear Sisters guild our hooves and forgive us for what we are about to do. We do this to avenge all of those who had fallen at the hooves of the Inquisition. Who do little more than bastardize and twist your ideas and your teachings. All in efforts to keep themselves fat, amused, and coffers full. They have taken so much from us and made us partake in so many sins and evils. Today Canterlot feels the wrath of the gods they pray to. Today Hollow Shades marches to war and the wrath of tartarus is coming with us! My tranquil brothers and sisters, Misty and the sisters are watching us. We are the sword they will drive through their black hearts. So let us not disappoint them!"\n\nSuddenly the sounds of cannons rang out and the bobbies fired tranquility tainted shells into the lands of Moon and Star. With that the legions of tranquility fueled ponies took up arms and began their march. Armed with whatever they could carry and get their hooves on to use as a weapon. The sea of masked ponies all having one goal in mind. Make Canterlot and the Inquisition suffer for what it has done. As they marched Willow turned his gaze to the statue of Misty on the hill. Through the fog he could almost see some strange wispy, pony shaped figure standing next to it. Looking down upon him and the marching army. Somehow deep down he knew what the figure was. In that moment he would truly smile again for the first time in a long time.\n\n§6#§!"My old friend, today we march for you. I march and lead these legions in your memory.""
