But beneath the carefully crafted cloak of glamour and sophistication, there lies a harsh reality of a House that is more vicious and powerhungry than any other. Schemers, spies, assassins and smoothtalkers - the Whitegolds prefer a more subtle approach to achieving their goals. They fight with words, wealth, and daggers - to challenge them is to play a deadly game of lies and deception against the very masters of the trade..."
