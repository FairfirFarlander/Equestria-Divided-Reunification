###Introduction###
##Bookmark##
HMS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:"Wizards, scientists, sages, and Unicorn supremacists desperately holding onto the old ways of the Celestial Sisters. With Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor playing a facade of legitimate royal rulers, the Archmagister Twilight Sparkle - the de facto ruler of the House - is free to focus on her plans to bring ascension upon the Unicorn race. All that while a well oiled Inquisitorial machine attempts to root out all signs of heresy within the realm. Anypony who speaks against the teachings of Celestia and Luna is a blasphemer and an enemy. Anypony who isn't a Unicorn is merely a tool to be used for ascension. Those are the truths of the House - accept them or have your will broken."
