###Introduction###
##Bookmark##
HMS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Wizards, scientists, sages, and Unicorn supremacists desperately holding onto the old ways of the Celestial Sisters. With Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor playing a facade of legitimate royal rulers, the Archmagister Twilight Sparkle - the de facto ruler of the House - is free to focus on her plans to bring ascension upon the Unicorn race. All that while a well oiled Inquisitorial machine attempts to root out all signs of heresy within the realm. Anypony who speaks against the teachings of Celestia and Luna is a blasphemer and an enemy. Anypony who isn't a Unicorn is merely a tool to be used for ascension. Those are the truths of the House - accept them or have your will broken."

To this end she must balance the various factions within House Moon and Star to maintain any semblance of working order. Should she fail in this delicate balancing act of politics and statecraft, §Rthere WILL be dire consequences§!."
