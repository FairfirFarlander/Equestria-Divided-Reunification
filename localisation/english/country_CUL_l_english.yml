   CUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Harmony is no more. Ponyville sits as a reminder of a bygone era where freindship and harmony was once the guiding principles of all ponykind. No longer.\n\nThe ruined hamlet is now a flooded landscape barren of the life; a memorial ground to the joy that once radiated from it's quaint homesteads. Yet even now extraordinary events are occuring within beckoning to those who would dare to venture within it's hollowed remains. The Houses have unanimously sealed off the region from prying eyes to observe and contain that which brews unseen.\n\nWhat manner of peril or calamity lies within?"

 ###Ideas###
  CUL_idea: "The dead shall have the last laugh."
   CUL_idea_desc: "After hiding in the shadows for nearly a decade, the Cult of Laughter finally rears it grotesque, grinning head. Mysterious, unpredictable, with it its goals unclear, the cult slowly spreads its influence over every corner of the war ravaged country. Ponies and non-Ponies alike, no matter if wealthy or poor, all are swayed by the promise of a better and brighter future filled with smiles, laughter, and the possibility of reunion with friends and loved ones who have been claimed by the years of pointless power struggles. With this mortal life so bleak, depressing, and full of pain, is not death an enclave of happiness? Is not laughter the best medicine for this disease that is consuming Equestria?"
