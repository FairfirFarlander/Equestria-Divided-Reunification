Mysterious, unpredictable, with it its goals unclear, the cult slowly spreads its influence over every corner of the war ravaged country. Ponies and non-Ponies alike, no matter if wealthy or poor, all are swayed by the promise of a better and brighter future filled with smiles, laughter, and the possibility of reunion with friends and loved ones who have been claimed by the years of pointless power struggles. With this mortal life so bleak, depressing, and full of pain, is not death an enclave of happiness? Is not laughter the best medicine for this disease that is consuming Equestria?"
