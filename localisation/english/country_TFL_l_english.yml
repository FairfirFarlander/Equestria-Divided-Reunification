   EAW_WS_TFL: "The Forgotten Legion"
    EAW_WS_TFL_desc: "A rag tag legion of Earthborn forces have found themselves deep within unfriendly territory, and surrounded on all sides by perceived enemies. But how did they find themselves in such a position? As the tensions were rising in the coalition, the mayor of Orshab began to fear the worst. Wanting to protect his citizens from whatever may come, he sent out messengers to the surrounding powers. Hoping that one of them would come to their aid. One of those messengers would be intercepted by a group of Earthborn soldiers who were manning the border between the coalition and Hoofington. Fearing that the messenger was a scout for some kind of enemy army, they would take him prisoner and take him to their camp to be detained. Upon reaching the camp, the soldiers were stopped by their commanding officer, a mare by the name of Rain Dancer. She confronted them, questioning why they had brought someone back to their encampment. When the soldiers began to tell her about the circumstances surrounding this messenger's capture, she pulled the stallion and began to question him herself. After hours of questioning it was clear to her that this stallion was no spy, so she went on to ask what he was doing in the lands of Earthborn. That was weeks ago now. The little coalition of towns has long since fallen apart. The mayor who sent out a call for aid has long since fled the town. And the once proud group of soldiers who came to these lands to secure them are running out of time. The few supplies that they were getting dried up as tensions between the confederacy and Earthborn began heating up once again."

   TFL_S00: "One Final Call For Help"
    TFL_S00_desc: "It has been weeks now since we have received any sort of word from Hoofington. We are running low on supplies and the morale of the troops is running low. We need to get a message out and see if we can get some kind of support."
    TFL_ES.00000.t: "The Reply"
     TFL_ES.00000.d: "After weeks of not receiving any sort of new orders or supplies from the higher ups back home, orders were given to send out a telegraph back to Hoofington. We waited and waited for any sort of response, but when we finally received a telegram back. You could see the color draining from the faces of the commander and telegraph operator as the message came through.\n\n==============================================\nMEMBERS  OF  THE  13th  EARTHBORN  LEGION,\nYOUR  ORDERS  ARE  AS  FOLLOWS.\nCONTINUE  TO  HOLD  OUT  AND  SECURE  THE  REGION.  WITH  TENSIONS EVER  RISING  FURTHER  SOUTH  ALL  RESOURCES  MUST  BE  DIVERTED. YOU  WILL  BE  RECEIVING  NO  FURTHER  AID.  YOU  ARE  NOT  TO  PULL  YOUR  FORCES  BACK  UNDER  ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES.  ANY  SOLDIER  FROM  THE  13TH  FOUND  TRYING  TO  COME  BACK  OVER  THE  BORDER  WILL  BE  TREATED  AS  A  DESERTER  AND  DEALT  WITH  ACCORDIGNLY.\n==============================================\n\nIt was at that moment Rain Danver came to a harsh and spine chilling realization..."
     TFL_ES.00000.a: "She and her troops were alone."

   TFL_S01A: "The Actions One Must Take To Survive"
    TFL_S01A_desc: "With no more supplies coming in we have no choice but to rely on less than moral options to keep our soldiers fed and supplied. The commander has given orders that raids can and will be organized on some of the neighboring territories. We can see it in her eyes though. She does not want to be reduced to this, but what choice do we have?"
    TFL_S01A_effect_tooltip: "§Y[TFL.GetName]§! will be able to conduct §Oraids§! on it's non-Earthborn neighbors."
   TFL_S01B: "Securing and Reassuring the Populace"
    TFL_S01B_desc: "The ponies who call Orshab home are scared, and we would be lying if we said we were not scared as well. But right now we need to secure this side of the rivers and rally the populace behind us. A few speeches from the commander and minor police work should do the trick, but all of that will not distract them from the threats across the river for long."
   TFL_S02A: "Every Single Hoof Counts Now"
    TFL_S02A_desc: "To deal with the lack of reinforcements coming we will have to open recruitment to ponies who call this region home. We can only hope that they will be able to actually follow orders and work well enough with Earthborn tactics."
    TFL_S02A_effect_tooltip: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will gain a §YProvincial Militia§! template and be able to §3edit§!, §7train§!, and §Odisband§! §Ydivision templates§!."
   TFL_S02B: "Forcing A Supply Train Our Way"
    TFL_S02B_desc: "Earthborn seems to have abandoned us up here. If we try to go back we will be treated as deserters, and if we continue to stay up here we will meet our end without fresh supply. We need a supplies willingly or not. We are going to have to force their hooves. There is at least one train that gets close enough for us to divert our way. But when we do this... They will consider us as traitors in their eyes."
    TFL_ssstrained_relations: "§OOutraged by Theft!§!"
    TFL_ES.02100.t: "Train Thieves"
     TFL_ES.02100.d: "With few opinions left and her troops running low on supply, Rain Dancer gave the order for a small group of volunteers to come forth. Asking for soldiers who had no families or ties back in Earthborn territory. All of those who stepped forward were briefed on what their mission would be. They were told the risks and were even offered the chance to turn down the mission. Knowing how desperate the soldiers of thirteenth were getting, none of them took the opportunity to opt from the mission. Each was given a few days worth of rations and were sent out towards the border..."
     TFL_ES.02100.a: "Towards the town of Trotland."
     TFL_ES.02101.d: "By the time they had reached the town It was a cold and foggy morning, and the sun had just barely begun to crest over the tops of the buildings. They could see their target stopped in Trotland train station. A twenty car train filled with supplies collected from the other satellite states of Earthborn. They could also see a small collection of clan guards and workers milling about the station. From what they figured it was a sort of skeleton crew that managed the station during the night and early morning hours. Thinking that this would be a much easier task than what they originally thought, the group pressed onwards. Slowly into the train yard and towards the station and their prize. Weapons drawn and ready for a fight, most would take up positions while a few others quickly moved to board the train. When they did, a commotion began emanating from the train. First yelling, then the sounds of struggles, and then the shot of a rifle.\n\nThe jig was up! The members of the clan guard at the station began to pour out towards the train to investigate. As they did, the members of the thirteenth opened fire upon them. Trying to buy as much time as they can for their comrades on the train to get it up and running. Suddenly a scream of the train’s whistle cut through the sounds of battle as it began to move. The ponies of the thirteenth began to rush towards the train. Jumping aboard as those already aboard opened fire on the clan guard. The iron beast chugged forward, slowly increasing in speed as it left the station and towards the border. The clan guard kept up for a while, firing upon the train all the way. But as it started pulling further and further away from it’s pursuers, the sounds of celebration and cheers roared from the train. A scraggly unicorn using his magic to hang the flag of the Thirteenth Earthborn Legion from the caboose as it left the clan guard in the dust."
     TFL_ES.02101.a: "Mission Complete!"
   TFL_S02C: "Fortifying Orshab"
    TFL_S02C_desc: "We were able to keep the town of Orshab secure when the little coalition fell apart, but now that we face the possibility of a full-on attack from that cult of those military remnants it is not clear if we can hold onto it. If we lose that town, we lose everything here. We need to do our best to fortify it against any attacks that may come our way."

   TFL_S03A: "Using the Terrain to Our Advantage"
    TFL_S03A_desc: "The land we have found ourselves in has mighty rivers that run all across it. Providing a natural wall against those just to the north. However, if we plan on actually bringing an end to the chaos here we will have to figure out ways to use those rivers to our advantage both on the defensive and offensive."
   TFL_S03B: "Running Off Ethanol"
    TFL_S03B_desc: "With the lack of any kind of real fuel source in the region we will have to be creative to keep our vehicles running. It is possible to make engines run off a few types of alcohol, but it will make them burn hotter and possibly break down a bit more often."
   TFL_S03C: "Setting Up Some Sort of Manufacturing"
    TFL_S03C_desc: "There are a few buildings in and around Orshab that could be used for manufacturing. The issue is making them into factories. Thankfully there are a few old machines laying around here and there, but without more we will not be able to mass produce much."
