   EAW_WS_TFL: "The Forgotten Legion"
    EAW_WS_TFL_desc: "A rag tag legion of Earthborn forces have found themselves deep within unfriendly territory, and surrounded on all sides by perceived enemies. But how did they find themselves in such a position? As the tensions were rising in the coalition, the mayor of Orshab began to fear the worst. Wanting to protect his citizens from whatever may come, he sent out messengers to the surrounding powers. Hoping that one of them would come to their aid. One of those messengers would be intercepted by a group of Earthborn soldiers who were manning the border between the coalition and Hoofington. Fearing that the messenger was a scout for some kind of enemy army, they would take him prisoner and take him to their camp to be detained. Upon reaching the camp, the soldiers were stopped by their commanding officer, a mare by the name of Rain Dancer. She confronted them, questioning why they had brought someone back to their encampment. When the soldiers began to tell her about the circumstances surrounding this messenger's capture, she pulled the stallion and began to question him herself. After hours of questioning it was clear to her that this stallion was no spy, so she went on to ask what he was doing in the lands of Earthborn. That was weeks ago now. The little coalition of towns has long since fallen apart. The mayor who sent out a call for aid has long since fled the town. And the once proud group of soldiers who came to these lands to secure them are running out of time. The few supplies that they were getting dried up as tensions between the confederacy and Earthborn began heating up once again."

   TFL_no_supply: "Dwindling Supplies"
    TFL_no_supply_desc: "For weeks now we have been without supplies from the homeland in this forsaken frontier. There are rumors that war is creeping in the south and that we are being left to fend for ourselves. Rationing has been instituted which has caused some to speak of requisitioning goods from the locals. Needless to say this has been prevented thus far, which has led to a growing deal of discontentment as our supplies dwindle further. If we do not act soon, a mutiny will surely follow."

   TFL_S0000: "One Final Call For Help"
    TFL_S0000_desc: "It has been weeks now since we have received any sort of word from Hoofington. We are running low on supplies and the morale of the troops is running low. We need to get a message out and see if we can get some kind of support."
    TFL_ES.000000.t: "The Reply"
     TFL_ES.000000.d: "After weeks of not receiving any sort of new orders or supplies from the higher ups back home, orders were given to send out a telegraph back to Hoofington. We waited and waited for any sort of response, but when we finally received a telegram back. You could see the color draining from the faces of the commander and telegraph operator as the message came through.\n\n==============================================\nMEMBERS  OF  THE  13th  EARTHBORN  LEGION,\nYOUR  ORDERS  ARE  AS  FOLLOWS.\nCONTINUE  TO  HOLD  OUT  AND  SECURE  THE  REGION.  WITH  TENSIONS EVER  RISING  FURTHER  SOUTH  ALL  RESOURCES  MUST  BE  DIVERTED. YOU  WILL  BE  RECEIVING  NO  FURTHER  AID.  YOU  ARE  NOT  TO  PULL  YOUR  FORCES  BACK  UNDER  ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES.  ANY  SOLDIER  FROM  THE  13TH  FOUND  TRYING  TO  COME  BACK  OVER  THE  BORDER  WILL  BE  TREATED  AS  A  DESERTER  AND  DEALT  WITH  ACCORDIGNLY.\n==============================================\n\nIt was at that moment Rain Dancer came to a harsh and spine chilling realization..."
     TFL_ES.000000.a: "She and her troops were alone."
   TFL_S0100: "The Actions One Must Take To Survive"
    TFL_S0100_desc: "With no more supplies coming in we have no choice but to rely on less than moral options to keep our soldiers fed and supplied. The commander has given orders that raids can and will be organized on some of the neighboring territories. We can see it in her eyes though. She does not want to be reduced to this, but what choice do we have?"
    TFL_S0100_cett: "§Y[TFL.GetName]§! will be able to conduct §Oraids§! on it's non-Earthborn neighbors."
   TFL_S0101: "Securing and Reassuring the Populace"
    TFL_S0101_desc: "The ponies who call Orshab home are scared, and we'd be lying if we said we were not scared as well. But right now we need to secure this side of the rivers and rally the populace behind us. A few speeches from the commander and minor police work should do the trick, but all of that will not distract them from the threats across the river for long."
    TFL_operational_reassurances: "Operational Reassurance and Security"
     TFL_operational_reassurances_desc: "For the moment we have scheduled conferences and speeches to address growing concerns. Patrols have been increased throughout the region in order to put the local ponies at ease. We cannot keep this up indefinitely however."
   TFL_S0200: "Every Single Hoof Counts Now"
    TFL_S0200_desc: "To deal with the lack of reinforcements we will have to open recruitment to ponies who call this region home. We can only hope that they'll be able to actually follow orders and work well enough with Earthborn tactics."
    TFL_S0200_effect_tooltip: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will gain a §YProvincial Militia§! template and be able to §3edit§!, §7train§!, and §Odisband§! §Ydivision templates§!."
   TFL_S0201: "Forcing A Supply Train Our Way"
    TFL_S0201_desc: "Earthborn seems to have abandoned us up here. If we try to go back we will be treated as deserters, and if we continue to stay up here we will meet our end without fresh supply. We need a supplies willingly or not. We are going to have to force their hooves. There is at least one train that gets close enough for us to divert our way. But when we do this... They will consider us as traitors in their eyes."
    TFL_ssstrained_relations: "§OOutraged§! by §OTheft!§!"
    TFL_ES.020100.t: "Train Thieves"
     TFL_ES.020100.d: "With few opinions left and her troops running low on supply, Rain Dancer gave the order for a small group of volunteers to come forth. Asking for soldiers who had no families or ties back in Earthborn territory. All of those who stepped forward were briefed on what their mission would be. They were told the risks and were even offered the chance to turn down the mission. Knowing how desperate the soldiers of thirteenth were getting, none of them took the opportunity to opt from the mission. Each was given a few days worth of rations and were sent out towards the border..."
     TFL_ES.020100.a: "Towards the town of Trotland."
     TFL_ES.020101.d: "By the time they had reached the town It was a cold and foggy morning, and the sun had just barely begun to crest over the tops of the buildings. They could see their target stopped in Trotland train station. A twenty car train filled with supplies collected from the other satellite states of Earthborn. They could also see a small collection of clan guards and workers milling about the station. From what they figured it was a sort of skeleton crew that managed the station during the night and early morning hours. Thinking that this would be a much easier task than what they originally thought, the group pressed onwards. Slowly into the train yard and towards the station and their prize. Weapons drawn and ready for a fight, most would take up positions while a few others quickly moved to board the train. When they did, a commotion began emanating from the train. First yelling, then the sounds of struggles, and then the shot of a rifle.\n\nThe jig was up! The members of the clan guard at the station began to pour out towards the train to investigate. As they did, the members of the thirteenth opened fire upon them. Trying to buy as much time as they can for their comrades on the train to get it up and running. Suddenly a scream of the train’s whistle cut through the sounds of battle as it began to move. The ponies of the thirteenth began to rush towards the train. Jumping aboard as those already aboard opened fire on the clan guard. The iron beast chugged forward, slowly increasing in speed as it left the station and towards the border. The clan guard kept up for a while, firing upon the train all the way. But as it started pulling further and further away from it’s pursuers, the sounds of celebration and cheers roared from the train. A scraggly unicorn using his magic to hang the flag of the Thirteenth Earthborn Legion from the caboose as it left the clan guard in the dust."
     TFL_ES.020101.a: "Mission Complete!"
   TFL_S0202: "Fortifying Orshab"
    TFL_S0202_desc: "We were able to keep the town of Orshab secure when the coalition fell apart. But now that we face the possibility of a full-on attack from that cult or those military remnants, it is unclear if we can hold onto it. If we lose that town, we lose everything here. We need to do our best to fortify it against any attacks that may come our way."
    TFL_ES.020300.t: "18 Lunatics and Their Gravel"
     TFL_ES.020300.d: "Some months ago an elderly pony petitioned the legion for a leasing agreement of the fort at Orshab and offered to garrison it with a handful of sentries. Seeing as we needed funding at the time, the pony in charge accepted the offer and directed the freed up soldiers elsewhere.\n\nFast forward to now and the fort has gathered a strange gaggle of shady characters. Every morning they wake up, split into two teams and make a huge ruckus during so called "exercises". We've come to learn that these lunatics have been at it for months; not counting the decades of tomfoolery beforehand. What may come of this is unclear, but the racket has been causing quite a disturbance among the locals. And yet for all the complaints the we will tolerate them on account of the quality gravel they manufacture and sell to us. All around it's a greasy deal, but it saves us time and resources."
     TFL_ES.020300.a: "We may not be wasting our money after all!"
   TFL_S0300: "Using the Terrain to Our Advantage"
    TFL_S0300_desc: "The land we have found ourselves in has mighty rivers that run all across it, providing a natural wall against those just to the north. However, if we plan on actually bringing an end to the chaos here we will have to figure out ways to use those rivers to our advantage both on the defensive and offensive."
    TFL_S0300_cett: "The §Y$TFL_river_pons$§! tech provides §Y§G+10% ATT/DEF§! over Rivers to Light Infantry§!.\nThis effect will be written in the description of the  national spirit §Y$TFL_operation_storms$§!."
    TFL_operation_storms: "Operation: Storms on the River"
     TFL_operation_storms_desc: "§WThe result of the §YRiver Ponies§! tech which grants §Y§G+10% ATT/DEF§! over Rivers to Light Infantry§!."
    TFL_river_pons: "$TFL_ADJ$ River Ponies"
     TFL_river_pons_desc: "§WThis idea represents the §YRiver Ponies§! tech, which provides a §Y§G+10% ATT/DEF§! over Rivers to Light Infantry§!."
   TFL_S0301: "Running Off Ethanol"
    TFL_S0301_desc: "With the lack of any kind of real fuel source in the region we will have to be creative to keep our vehicles running. It is possible to make engines run off a few types of alcohol, but it will make them burn hotter and possibly break down a bit more often."
   TFL_S0302: "Setting Up Some Sort of Manufacturing"
    TFL_S0302_desc: "There are a few buildings in and around Orshab that could be used for manufacturing. The issue is making them into factories. Thankfully there are a few old machines laying around here and there, but without more we will not be able to mass produce much."
   TFL_S0400: "A Semi Functional Tank Workshop"
    TFL_S0400_desc: "With the border now completely shut off to us no new armored vehicles will be coming to us any time soon. So the commander has been trying to piece together a sort of deal with some of the locals and our engineers. She believes that we could get a small-scale tank building operation in Orshab, but it will take some time and production will be limited. At least we will have some armor and spare parts on hoof."
    TFL_ES.040000.t: "The River Tractors"
     TFL_ES.040000.d: "While we were studying the waterways we had been coming across a growing number of old tractors scattered about. Our engineers see them as spare parts and scrap, but our tankers have been seeing them as something else. On their off time a few of them have been tinkering with a few of them. And today one of them drove the tractor he was working on back into town. It was a rather goofy sight of scrap and rusted tractor, but he seemed rather proud of it. He claimed that he was able to make it able to go up against the might of the rivers. Of course we all looked at him like he was some kind of mad pony, but then one of our engineers got to looking at it. She believes that what this soldier put together could actually manage to cross some bodies of water with a little more tinkering and testing.\n\nSo guess who is now the engineer’s favorite tanker and gets extra rations while the rest of us go out and gather the rest of those old tractors. At least we may have something that will help us in the river lands in this place. However, many of us still have doubts about these old tractors turned armored tubs. Hopefully we will all be pleasantly surprised when they are all put together and put to the test."
     TFL_ES.040000.a: "Lets see what this baby can do!"
   TFL_S0401: "Setting Standards and Improving Tools"
    TFL_S0401_desc: "With the state everything is in around here, that limited production we have has been slow; far, far too slow to keep up with any actual demand. We need to get our hooves on some proper tools and machinery to help with production. The engineers could put some together, but it will take time."
   TFL_S0402: "Guns Aimed Skyward"
    TFL_S0402_desc: "What that cult may have is a mystery, but what those wonderbolts have is clear. We will be facing planes and even possibly airships. We need a way to shoot them down, and we do not have the infrastructure to set up an airstrip; let alone construct any planes. So we will have to think a little outside of the box. Perhaps we could manufacture some crude anti-air."
   TFL_S0403: "The Carotene Road"
    TFL_S0403_desc: "Rockville has always been just a little bit different from the other states under the control of Earthborn. Not melding well with most of their ideas when it comes to politics or trade. With that being said, they still are still loyal servants of Earthborn. That does not mean that some of their populace on the border would be unwilling to trade."
    TFL_sekret_trade: "The Secret Trade"
     TFL_sekret_trade_desc: "[TFL_sekret_trade_desc] This flow of goods is no doubt a major boon to our economic situation, though the Earthborn government will inevitably crack down on this violation of foreign policy. We should make full use of this arrangement while it lasts."
     TFL_sekret_trade_PIE: "Our citizens have taken a liking to [TFL.GetAdjective] agricultural goods and have begun to trade with our northern neighbors. "
     TFL_sekret_trade_TFL: "We've established an informal trade relation with the citizens of [PIE.GetNameDef]. "
   TFL_S0500: "The Veteran and His Crazed Followers"
    TFL_S0500_desc: "We can no longer sit around and wait for them to come to us. It is time that we crossed that river and marched against that crazed preacher and his followers."
   TFL_S0501: "The Remnants of The Old World"
    TFL_S0501_desc: "Just across the river is an enemy we all have come to fear. Wonderbolts who stayed loyal to the old Equestrian Government after the division. They have rallied the ponies of Cloudsdale behind them and have access to equipment we could only dream of."
   TFL_S0600: "The Cult’s Stockpiles"
    TFL_S0600_desc: "As we begin to restore order and clean up the mess the cult left behind, we have started to come across storehouses and designs of theirs. Inside were guns, food, and even a few old planes they somehow managed to fashioned into fighters. We need to find as many of these stashes that we can. If they are anything like the ones we found already, there is no telling what all could be in them."
    TFL_S0600_cett: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will receive §Y10 Early Fighter Aircraft§!."
   TFL_S0601: "The Liberation of Cloudsdale"
    TFL_S0601_desc: "The last remnants of the old Equestrian military have surrendered, and our flag now flies within Cloudsdale. The commander has ordered that no prisoners shall be taken and for some of us to begin handing out extra rations of food and water to the citizens. We can understand why though. While we lowered those tattered old flags that flew in the city, we could see a spark fading from their eyes. None of us can not help but to take pity on them."
   TFL_S0700: "Reach Out to Those Who Followed the Cult"
    TFL_S0700_desc: "Since defeating Poppy Seed's followers we've been welcomed as liberators and heroes by many in their lands, but many former cult members still look on us with disdain and anger. We hope to change this by reaching out to the less radical members who survived that war, to show them that we mean no harm as long as they do not stir up trouble. Let them keep their religion so long as they work with us."
    TFL_outreach_programs: "Outreach Programs"
     TFL_outreach_programs_desc: "We are making great strides to bring the former cult members into the fold. This will take some time to complete. We will help them come around eventually."
   TFL_S0701: "The Train From Hoofington"
    TFL_S0701_desc: "We received a telegram about a train coming into the region from Hoof City. It was not clear though just who or what was on the train. We will just have to wait to see when it reaches the station."
   TFL_S0702: "Weather Under the Wings"
    TFL_S0702_desc: "After taking Cloudsdale the commander has requested that the remaining belligerents be gathered before her. When they had all gathered together, Rain Dancer spoke to them as compatriots and friends rather than enemies who had just been defeated. She offered them all rations, water, and safety for the ponies of Cloudsdale if they would accept a place within our ranks. Would they accept her offer?"
    TFL_S0702_cett: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will gain a §YWonderbolt Regiment§! template containing §Y4 Pegasi Battalions§!."
