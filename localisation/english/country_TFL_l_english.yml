   EAW_WS_TFL: "The Forgotten Legion"
    EAW_WS_TFL_desc: "A rag tag legion of Earthborn forces have found themselves deep within unfriendly territory, and surrounded on all sides by perceived enemies. But how did they find themselves in such a position? As the tensions were rising in the coalition, the mayor of Orshab began to fear the worst. Wanting to protect his citizens from whatever may come, he sent out messengers to the surrounding powers. Hoping that one of them would come to their aid. One of those messengers would be intercepted by a group of Earthborn soldiers who were manning the border between the coalition and Hoofington. Fearing that the messenger was a scout for some kind of enemy army, they would take him prisoner and take him to their camp to be detained. Upon reaching the camp, the soldiers were stopped by their commanding officer, a mare by the name of Rain Dancer. She confronted them, questioning why they had brought someone back to their encampment. When the soldiers began to tell her about the circumstances surrounding this messenger's capture, she pulled the stallion and began to question him herself. After hours of questioning it was clear to her that this stallion was no spy, so she went on to ask what he was doing in the lands of Earthborn. That was weeks ago now. The little coalition of towns has long since fallen apart. The mayor who sent out a call for aid has long since fled the town. And the once proud group of soldiers who came to these lands to secure them are running out of time. The few supplies that they were getting dried up as tensions between the confederacy and Earthborn began heating up once again."

   TFL_S00: "One Final Call For Help"
    TFL_S00_desc: "It has been weeks now since we have received any sort of word from Hoofington. We are running low on supplies and the morale of the troops is running low. We need to get a message out and see if we can get some kind of support."
    TFL_ES.0001.t: "The Reply"
     TFL_ES.0001.d: "After weeks of not receiving any sort of new orders or supplies from the higher ups back home, orders were given to send out a telegraph back to Hoofington. We waited and waited for any sort of response, but when we finally received a telegram back. You could see the color draining from the faces of the commander and telegraph operator as the message came through.\n\n==============================================\nMEMBERS  OF  THE  13th  EARTHBORN  LEGION,\nYOUR  ORDERS  ARE  AS  FOLLOWS.\nCONTINUE  TO  HOLD  OUT  AND  SECURE  THE  REGION.  WITH  TENSIONS EVER  RISING  FURTHER  SOUTH  ALL  RESOURCES  MUST  BE  DIVERTED. YOU  WILL  BE  RECEIVING  NO  FURTHER  AID.  YOU  ARE  NOT  TO  PULL  YOUR  FORCES  BACK  UNDER  ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES.  ANY  SOLDIER  FROM  THE  13TH  FOUND  TRYING  TO  COME  BACK  OVER  THE  BORDER  WILL  BE  TREATED  AS  A  DESERTER  AND  DEALT  WITH  ACCORDIGNLY.\n==============================================\n\nIt was at that moment Rain Danver came to a harsh and spine chilling realization, she and her troops were alone."

   TFL_S01A: "The Actions One Must Take To Survive"
    TFL_S01A_desc: "With no more supplies coming in we have no choice but to rely on less than moral options to keep our soldiers fed and supplied. The commander has given orders that raids can and will be organized on some of the neighboring territories. We can see it in her eyes though. She does not want to be reduced to this, but what choice do we have?"

   TFL_S01B: "Securing and Reassuring the Populace"
    TFL_S01B_desc: "The ponies who call Orshab home are scared, and we would be lying if we said we were not scared as well. But right now we need to secure this side of the rivers and rally the populace behind us. A few speeches from the commander and minor police work should do the trick, but all of that will not distract them from the threats across the river for long."
