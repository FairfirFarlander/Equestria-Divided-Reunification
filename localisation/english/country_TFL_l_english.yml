   TFL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Where once there was a collection of villages bound to defend their homes in the valley, now lies a shattered community. In such a dire situation enters the 13th Legion of the Earthborn Coalition Army under the command of Rain Dancer, whom had entered the region to investigate enemy movements. Instead they had discovered a volatile powder keg of tension and strife along the old valley. Between a cult of madponies to the north and an uncompromising remnant to the east, the Legion finds itself in a power struggle for survival. To make matters worse, their Hoofington ally seems to have forgotten them as supplies dwindle. Without heart to abandon her fellow Equestrians, there lies one choice."

   EAW_WS_TFL: "§gThe Forgotten Legion§!"
    EAW_WS_TFL_desc: "A rag tag legion of §OEarthborn forces§! have found themselves deep within unfriendly territory, and surrounded on all sides by perceived enemies. But how did they find themselves in such a position? As the tensions were rising in the §Ycoalition§!, the §Ymayor of Orshab§! began to fear the worst. Wanting to protect his citizens from whatever may come, he sent out messengers to the surrounding powers, hoping that one of them would come to their aid.\n\nOne of those messengers would be intercepted by a group of §gEarthborn soldiers§! who were manning the border between the coalition and §9Hoofington§!. Fearing that the messenger was a scout for some kind of enemy army, they would take him prisoner and take him to their camp to be detained. Upon reaching the camp, the soldiers were stopped by their commanding officer; a mare by the name of §gRain Dancer§!. She confronted them, questioning why they had brought someone back to their encampment. When the soldiers began to tell her about the circumstances surrounding this messenger's capture, she pulled the stallion and began to question him herself. After hours of questioning it was clear to her that this stallion was no spy, so she went on to ask what he was doing in the lands of Earthborn.\n\nThat was weeks ago now. The little coalition of towns has long since fallen apart. The mayor who sent out a call for aid has long since fled the town. And the once proud group of soldiers who came to these lands to secure them are running out of time. The §Rfew supplies§! that they were getting dried up as tensions between the §gConfederacy§! and §OEarthborn§! began heating up once again."

   TFL_13th_legion: "The 13th Earthborn Legion"
    TFL_13th_legion_desc: "The 13th Earthborn Legion is a unit within the wider Earthborn coalition having been formed largely out of Orange Country (Hoofington) volunteers and conscripts. Stationed in the northern reaches of Earthborn territory, their primary objective is to guard the border against Stormwing and Moonstar raids as well as to tend the stately affairs of the Hoofington territories.\n\nThey are one of the few units in the Earthborn military that are equipped with motorized transport and armored vehicles on account of Hoofington's industrial prowess and Equestrian stockpiles from the Crystal War. Placed under the command of Rain Dancer, they are a force to be reckoned with."
   TFL_forgotten_legion: "The Forgotten Legion"
    TFL_forgotten_legion_desc: "The Forgotten Legion was once known as the 13th Earthborn and formerly served the coalition of a similar name. They have since turned away from them after the betrayal of their Hoofington allies to everything they stood for. The Legion now stands in a forgotten frontier, deciding for themselves what their fate may be. With their vast stores of equipment and vastly increased numbers, the legion is a lethal force to be reckoned with in the region."
   TFL_no_supply: "Dwindling Supplies"
    TFL_no_supply_desc: "For weeks now we have been without supplies from the homeland in this forsaken frontier. There are rumors that war is creeping in the south and that we are being left to fend for ourselves. Rationing has been instituted which has caused some to speak of requisitioning goods from the locals. Needless to say this has been prevented thus far, which has led to a growing deal of discontentment as our supplies dwindle further. If we do not act soon, a mutiny will surely follow."

    TFL_S0000_desc: "It has been weeks now since we have received any sort of word from Hoofington. We are running low on supplies and the morale of the troops is running low. We need to get a message out and see if we can get some kind of support."
    TFL_ES.000000.t: "The Reply"
     TFL_ES.000000.d: "After weeks of not receiving any sort of new orders or supplies from the higher ups back home, orders were given to send out a telegraph back to Hoofington. We waited and waited for any sort of response, but when we finally received a telegram back. You could see the color draining from the faces of the commander and telegraph operator as the message came through.\n\n==============================================\nMEMBERS  OF  THE  13th  EARTHBORN  LEGION,\nYOUR  ORDERS  ARE  AS  FOLLOWS.\nCONTINUE  TO  HOLD  OUT  AND  SECURE  THE  REGION.  WITH  TENSIONS EVER  RISING  FURTHER  SOUTH  ALL  RESOURCES  MUST  BE  DIVERTED. YOU  WILL  BE  RECEIVING  NO  FURTHER  AID.  YOU  ARE  NOT  TO  PULL  YOUR  FORCES  BACK  UNDER  ANY  CIRCUMSTANCES.  ANY  SOLDIER  FROM  THE  13TH  FOUND  TRYING  TO  COME  BACK  OVER  THE  BORDER  WILL  BE  TREATED  AS  A  DESERTER  AND  DEALT  WITH  ACCORDIGNLY.\n==============================================\n\nIt was at that moment Rain Dancer came to a harsh and spine chilling realization..."
     TFL_ES.000000.a: "She and her troops were alone."
   TFL_S0100: "The Actions One Must Take To Survive"
    TFL_S0100_desc: "With no more supplies coming in we have no choice but to rely on less than moral options to keep our soldiers fed and supplied. The commander has given orders that raids can and will be organized on some of the neighboring territories. We can see it in her eyes though. She does not want to be reduced to this, but what choice do we have?"
    TFL_S0100_cett: "§Y[TFL.GetName]§! will be able to conduct §Oraids§! on it's non-Earthborn neighbors.\n§ONote that most targets are much stronger than us.§!"
   TFL_S0101: "Securing and Reassuring the Populace"
    TFL_S0101_desc: "The ponies who call Orshab home are scared, and we'd be lying if we said we were not scared as well. But right now we need to secure this side of the rivers and rally the populace behind us. A few speeches from the commander and minor police work should do the trick, but all of that will not distract them from the threats across the river for long."
    TFL_operational_reassurances: "Operational Reassurance and Security"
     TFL_operational_reassurances_desc: "For the moment we have scheduled conferences and speeches to address growing concerns. Patrols have been increased throughout the region in order to put the local ponies at ease. We cannot keep this up indefinitely however."
   TFL_S0200: "Every Single Hoof Counts Now"
    TFL_S0200_desc: "To deal with the lack of reinforcements we will have to open recruitment to ponies who call this region home. We can only hope that they'll be able to actually follow orders and work well enough with Earthborn tactics."

   TFL_S0201: "Forcing A Supply Train Our Way"
    TFL_S0201_desc: "Earthborn seems to have abandoned us up here. If we try to go back we will be treated as deserters, and if we continue to stay up here we will meet our end without fresh supply. We need a supplies willingly or not. We are going to have to force their hooves. There is at least one train that gets close enough for us to divert our way. But when we do this... They will consider us as traitors in their eyes."
    TFL_ssstrained_relations: "§OOutraged§! by §OTheft!§!"
    TFL_ES.020100.t: "Train Thieves"
     TFL_ES.020100.d: "With few opinions left and her troops running low on supply, Rain Dancer gave the order for a small group of volunteers to come forth. Asking for soldiers who had no families or ties back in Earthborn territory. All of those who stepped forward were briefed on what their mission would be. They were told the risks and were even offered the chance to turn down the mission. Knowing how desperate the soldiers of thirteenth were getting, none of them took the opportunity to opt from the mission. Each was given a few days worth of rations and were sent out towards the border..."
     TFL_ES.020100.a: "Towards the town of Trotland."
     TFL_ES.020101.d: "By the time they had reached the town It was a cold and foggy morning, and the sun had just barely begun to crest over the tops of the buildings. They could see their target stopped in Trotland train station. A twenty car train filled with supplies collected from the other satellite states of Earthborn. They could also see a small collection of clan guards and workers milling about the station. From what they figured it was a sort of skeleton crew that managed the station during the night and early morning hours. Thinking that this would be a much easier task than what they originally thought, the group pressed onwards. Slowly into the train yard and towards the station and their prize. Weapons drawn and ready for a fight, most would take up positions while a few others quickly moved to board the train. When they did, a commotion began emanating from the train. First yelling, then the sounds of struggles, and then the shot of a rifle.\n\nThe jig was up! The members of the clan guard at the station began to pour out towards the train to investigate. As they did, the members of the thirteenth opened fire upon them. Trying to buy as much time as they can for their comrades on the train to get it up and running. Suddenly a scream of the train’s whistle cut through the sounds of battle as it began to move. The ponies of the thirteenth began to rush towards the train. Jumping aboard as those already aboard opened fire on the clan guard. The iron beast chugged forward, slowly increasing in speed as it left the station and towards the border. The clan guard kept up for a while, firing upon the train all the way. But as it started pulling further and further away from it’s pursuers, the sounds of celebration and cheers roared from the train. A scraggly unicorn using his magic to hang the flag of the Thirteenth Earthborn Legion from the caboose as it left the clan guard in the dust."
     TFL_ES.020101.a: "Mission Complete!"
     TFL_some_supply: "Stabilized Supplies"
      TFL_some_supply_desc: "With our recent raid, we've finnaly been able to stabilize our supply situation. By no means does this mean we are in a good situation. We will need to secure more supplies in order to enable our full operational capacity."
   TFL_S0202: "Setting Up Some Sort of Manufacturing"
    TFL_S0202_desc: "There are a few buildings in and around Orshab that could be used for manufacturing. The issue is making them into factories. Thankfully there are a few old machines laying around here and there, but without more we will not be able to mass produce much."
   TFL_S0300: "Using the Terrain to Our Advantage"
    TFL_S0300_desc: "The land we have found ourselves in has mighty rivers that run all across it, providing a natural wall against those just to the north. However, if we plan on actually bringing an end to the chaos here we will have to figure out ways to use those rivers to our advantage both on the defensive and offensive."
    TFL_S0300_cett: "The §Y$TFL_river_pons$§! tech provides §Y§G+10% ATT/DEF§! over Rivers to Light Infantry§!.\nWill also gain a §YRiverpony regiment§!."

   TFL_S0301: "Running Off Ethanol"
    TFL_S0301_desc: "With the lack of any kind of real fuel source in the region we will have to be creative to keep our vehicles running. It is possible to make engines run off a few types of alcohol, but it will make them burn hotter and possibly break down a bit more often."
   TFL_S0302: "Fortifying Orshab"
    TFL_S0302_desc: "We were able to keep the town of Orshab secure when the coalition fell apart. But now that we face the possibility of a full-on attack from that cult or those military remnants, it is unclear if we can hold onto it. If we lose that town, we lose everything here. We need to do our best to fortify it against any attacks that may come our way."
    TFL_S0302_cett: "§YStallion Co.§! will build the fortifications."
    TFL_ES.030200.t: "18 Lunatics and Their Gravel"
     TFL_ES.030200.d: "Some months ago an elderly pony petitioned the legion for a leasing agreement of the fort at Orshab and offered to garrison it with a handful of sentries. Seeing as we needed funding at the time, the pony in charge accepted the offer and directed the freed up soldiers elsewhere.\n\nFast forward to now and the fort has gathered a strange gaggle of shady characters. Every morning they wake up, split into two teams and make a huge ruckus during so called "exercises". We've come to learn that these lunatics have been at it for months; not counting the decades of tomfoolery beforehand. What may come of this is unclear, but the racket has been causing quite a disturbance among the locals.\n\nAnd yet for all the complaints are tolerated on account of the quality gravel they manufacture and sell to us. In turn we've been selling this gravel to the local townships to repair the roads throughout the province. All around it's a greasy deal, but it saves us time and resources."
     TFL_ES.030200.a: "I may not be wasting our money after all!"
     TFL_ES.030200.cett: "§YStallion Co.§! has finally established itself.\nIt will now be §Gunlocked§! as an Industrial Concern."
     TFL_stallion_co_established: "Stallion Co. is well establish."
   TFL_S0400: "A Semi Functional Tank Workshop"
    TFL_S0400_desc: "With the border now completely shut off to us no new armored vehicles will be coming to us any time soon. So the commander has been trying to piece together a sort of deal with some of the locals and our engineers. She believes that we could get a small-scale tank building operation in Orshab, but it will take some time and production will be limited. At least we will have some armor and spare parts on hoof."
    TFL_S0400_cett: "§YThe Foreign Legion§! template receives a light tank battalion armed with §Y13 old Equestrian Yak Tanks§!."
    TFL_ES.040000.t: "The River Tractors"
     TFL_ES.040000.d: "While we were studying the waterways we had been coming across a growing number of old tractors scattered about. Our engineers see them as spare parts and scrap, but our tankers have been seeing them as something else. On their off time a few of them have been tinkering with a few of them. And today one of them drove the tractor he was working on back into town. It was a rather goofy sight of scrap and rusted tractor, but he seemed rather proud of it. He claimed that he was able to make it able to go up against the might of the rivers. Of course we all looked at him like he was some kind of mad pony, but then one of our engineers got to looking at it. She believes that what this soldier put together could actually manage to cross some bodies of water with a little more tinkering and testing.\n\nSo guess who is now the engineer’s favorite tanker and gets extra rations while the rest of us go out and gather the rest of those old tractors. At least we may have something that will help us in the river lands in this place. However, many of us still have doubts about these old tractors turned armored tubs. Hopefully we will all be pleasantly surprised when they are all put together and put to the test."
     TFL_ES.040000.a: "Lets see what this baby can do!"
   TFL_S0401: "Setting Standards and Improving Tools"
    TFL_S0401_desc: "With the state everything is in around here, that limited production we have has been slow; far, far too slow to keep up with any actual demand. We need to get our hooves on some proper tools and machinery to help with production. The engineers could put some together, but it will take time."
   TFL_S0402: "The Carotene Road"
    TFL_S0402_desc: "Rockville has always been just a little bit different from the other states under the control of Earthborn. Not melding well with most of their ideas when it comes to politics or trade. With that being said, they still are still loyal servants of Earthborn. That does not mean that some of their populace on the border would be unwilling to trade."
    TFL_much_supply: "Growing Supplies"
     TFL_much_supply_desc: "We have managed to secure more supplies from various sources and are nearly able to operate at full capacity. However it is not enough to allow us such freedom of movement. The only way we will be able to secure such logistical considerations seems to be by conquering the rest of the valley. Surely the caches of supplies the Cult and the Remnant have will enable us to operate fully in the region."
    TFL_sekret_trade: "The Secret Trade"
     TFL_sekret_trade_desc: "[TFL_sekret_trade_desc] This flow of goods is no doubt a major boon to our economic situation, though the Earthborn government will inevitably crack down on this violation of foreign policy. We should make full use of this arrangement while it lasts."
     TFL_sekret_trade_PIE: "Our citizens have taken a liking to [TFL.GetAdjective] agricultural goods and have begun to trade with our northern neighbors. "
     TFL_sekret_trade_TFL: "We've established an informal trade relation with the citizens of [PIE.GetNameDef]. "
   TFL_S0403: "Guns Aimed Skyward"
    TFL_S0403_desc: "What that cult may have is a mystery, but what those wonderbolts have is clear. We will be facing planes and even possibly airships. We need a way to shoot them down, and we do not have the infrastructure to set up an airstrip; let alone construct any planes. So we will have to think a little outside of the box. Perhaps we could manufacture some crude anti-air."
    TFL_S0403_cett: "A §YSupply Hub§! will be placed on the west side of the hill next to the northern river."
   TFL_S0500: "The Veteran and His Crazed Followers"
    TFL_S0500_desc: "We can no longer sit around and wait for them to come to us. It is time that we crossed that river and marched against that crazed preacher and his followers."
   TFL_S0501: "The Remnants of The Old World"
    TFL_S0501_desc: "Just across the river is an enemy we all have come to fear. Wonderbolts who stayed loyal to the old Equestrian Government after the division. They have rallied the ponies of Cloudsdale behind them and have access to equipment we could only dream of."
   TFL_S0600: "The Cult’s Stockpiles"
    TFL_S0600_desc: "As we begin to restore order and clean up the mess the cult left behind, we have started to come across storehouses and designs of theirs. Inside were guns, food, and even a few old planes they somehow managed to fashioned into fighters. We need to find as many of these stashes that we can. If they are anything like the ones we found already, there is no telling what all could be in them."
    TFL_S0600_cett: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will receive §Y10 Early Fighter Aircraft§!."
   TFL_S0601: "The Liberation of Cloudsdale"
    TFL_S0601_desc: "The last remnants of the old Equestrian military have surrendered, and our flag now flies within Cloudsdale. The commander has ordered that no prisoners shall be taken and for some of us to begin handing out extra rations of food and water to the citizens. We can understand why though. While we lowered those tattered old flags that flew in the city, we could see a spark fading from their eyes. None of us can not help but to take pity on them."
   TFL_S0700: "Reach Out to Those Who Followed the Cult"
    TFL_S0700_desc: "Since defeating Poppy Seed's followers we've been welcomed as liberators and heroes by many in their lands, but many former cult members still look on us with disdain and anger. We hope to change this by reaching out to the less radical members who survived that war, to show them that we mean no harm as long as they do not stir up trouble. Let them keep their religion so long as they work with us."
    TFL_outreach_programs: "Outreach Programs"
     TFL_outreach_programs_desc: "We are making great strides to bring the former cult members into the fold. This will take some time to complete. We will help them come around eventually."
   TFL_S0701: "The Train From Hoofington"
    TFL_S0701_desc: "We received a telegram about a train coming into the region from Hoof City. It was not clear though just who or what was on the train. We will just have to wait to see when it reaches the station."
    TFL_ES.070100.t: "A Train of Vultures"
     TFL_ES.070100.d: "Word that a train was finally coming across the river again had spread quickly through the ranks of the 13th. Many of the troops were hopeful that it would be a sign of good things. Many of them gathered around the station. Waiting to see what this locomotive would bring, but when it finally arrived at that station, any hopes and ideas we had were dashed. What arrived at the station was no cargo train filled with supplies or cars of fresh troops to replace us. Instead what they saw was a train pulling along cars that radiated the look and stink of the upper echelon.\n\nWe all looked at one another confused for a moment. What could something like this mean? Were we going to be shipped back home in luxury? We soon got our answer when the doors to the cars opened up and we saw the ponies who were strolling out. Ponies who many would deem as little more than vultures. Stallions and mares who were looking to expand their influences and wealth into this newly stabilized region. What followed behind them was a small batch of soldiers from Hoofington carrying a trunk. One of them would pull out a letter and clear their throat. Preparing to speak as the trunk was sat down before us all."
     TFL_ES.070100.a: "Continue"
     TFL_ES.070101.d: ""Brave and loyal soldiers of the 13th legion, Hoofington and Earthborn would like to thank you all for your bravery. You have shown true Equestrian strength, passion, and might by bringing order to these lands. Please, step forward each or you and claim a medal. So that all may know of your bravery and sacrifices here. Once you do, we ask that you return to your posts as your mission is not quite over yet."\n\nAs he finished his little speech, the trunk was opened. Revealing the large mound of medals inside. The vultures whispers and grumbles of anger were quickly swirling through our ranks. Many of us held back what we truly wanted to say, what we truly wanted to do. That is until the voice of Rain Dancer cut through our whispers.\n\n"Members of the 13th...""
     TFL_ES.070101.a: "Steady your minds and gather your medals. We still have work to do! Soon we'll be back home."

    TFL_ES.070102.t: "Back On the Train"
     TFL_ES.070102.d: "We knew what must be done. What we were about to do once. When Rain Dancer had given her orders a eerie quietness filled the air as the Earthborn soldiers looked towards our captain once they had realized what she said. You could hear a pin drop within that train station if it was not for the locomotive letting off steam. Without another word, we raised our weapons, taking aim at the Earthborn soldiers and all those who came on the train with them.\n\nWhat came over us all we may never truly know. Was it rage of some kind? A deep seeded hatred that had been growing and finally reached its threshold? It matters little now, and even less in that moment. We loaded all of them back onto the train. Along with the trunk containing the hunks of tin they called symbols of service and honor. We ordered the engineers to take the train back across the river and out of the region. With our rifles pointed at them, they offered little in the way of protest against our orders. Within moments the train had begun to move again, taking all of those ponies back home."
     TFL_ES.070102.a: "Back to the lands that we once called home."

Some were even beginning to want to go back to the way things were under the cult of the Wonderbolts. We need to work quickly if we want to stabilize the region and keep it from falling apart again. It seems that no matter how many times we get close to bringing order to this place, it all seems to fall apart. What are they going to do if we ever fall?

    TFL_S0900_desc: "The land is quickly falling into chaos again around us before our very eyes. We need to do something and we need to do it fast."
    TFL_ES.090000.t: "Chain Of Command"
     TFL_ES.090000.d: "To ensure that some semblance of order stays established in the region, a chain of command has been established with Rain Dancer at its head. The locals were rather weary at first, but with little options and even fewer leader-like figures to turn to, they placed their faith in Rain Dancer and us. The leaders of the different towns have their say in local and internal affairs, but all of them answer to the chain of command within our ranks.\n\nA military junta... Dear sisters, what have been reduced to? We came to this land to be heroes or liberators. Now we stand here as it conquers. If there was any other viable option I am sure that we would take it. After all we are no politicians, but if we did not take up the role this place would surely fall back into chaos. All of the blood and sweat we spent would go to waste."
     TFL_ES.090000.a: "We can not let that happen."
   TFL_S0901: "Passage For Our Families"
    TFL_S0901_desc: "Most creatures who are a part of this gaggle of misfits we call the Thirteenth still have families back in the lands of Earthborn. Many have fears that their loved ones will end up being the ones who are punished for our crimes against Earthborn. Rain Dancer seems to have a plan though, but it involves dealing with a member of Earthborn."
    TFL_ES.090100.t: "The Passage"
     TFL_ES.090100.d: "With growing fears of some kind of retaliation, Rain Dancer has called upon some of us to be messengers of a sort. Messengers who would try and guarantee some kind of safe passage for our families and loved ones out of Earthborn territory and bring them back here. However, when she gave us our mission details most of us looked on in confusion and concern. She wanted to place her trust in the farming families on the outskirts of the Rockville territory just to our south. Now many of us knew that their loyalty to Earthborn was a muddy one, but could we really trust them? Did we really have any other choice not to?\n\nWhen the time came to proceed with our mission, we were surprised for the lack of a better term that the farmers would even hear our pleas. Let alone agree to even help us. Granted some would only do it for a little coin, but none of us could blame them. Most of them would agree to turn a blind eye to us, a few even offered to let us stay in their barns on our way back. May the sisters bless them. There are still some decent ponies left in the hellscape.\n\nOver the next few days, most of our loved ones were able to get out of Earthborn territory. Trip, after trip, after trip. But it was all worth it in the end. Our loved ones would be spared of any wrath Earthborn or Hoofington would bring against them for our actions. At least until the day comes they try to march upon us."
     TFL_ES.090100.a: "Reunited we will see it through."
   TFL_S1000: "The Cult’s Old Transmitters"
    TFL_S1000_desc: "Before the ponies of Pondesa were brought to heel, their old leader was broadcasting his sermons over old radios and loud speakers. There is no doubt that we could use that tech to our own advantage, but it will take time to build more and do it reliably."
   TFL_S1001: "Armored Monsters Of Our Own"
    TFL_S1001_desc: "Many of us remember the stories of how the engineers of Earthborn would spend tireless hours working on these monstrous beasts of war. Large tanks hauling the fire power of a small battleship with them wherever they go. Of course those were only legends, but those stories have inspired us. We may not be able to build anything that massive. However, we can build a bigger tank of our own."
   TFL_S1002: "The Miracles of Cloudsdale"
    TFL_S1002_desc: "In truth many of us doubted just how mighty and magical the city of Cloudsdale was. But ever since we laid our eyes upon it we understood just why so many held it in high regard. And now that the city flies our banner, we can use the wonders of the city to help us."
   TFL_S1100: "Strong Hearts, But Even Stronger Borders"
    TFL_S1100_desc: "Our tactics in warfare have never wronged us before.  However, we have to realize that we are no longer going to be on the offensive. At least not for a while. We will have to prepare to defend our new home and embrace new tactics if we want to survive."
   TFL_S1101: "Rallying The Locals Behind Us"
    TFL_S1101_desc: "With the world in chaos around us and a massive enemy threatening to bare down on our heads, the time to unite is now. There are probably many ponies here who see us as conquers more so than liberators now, but there is little we can do to mend that now. We must rally the region behind us before it is too late. The clutches of Tarderous are around us as we speak. They are just waiting for the right time to start squeezing."
    TFL_S1101_cett: "Three divisions of §YState Militia§! will be raised."
   TFL_S1102: "The Old Library"
    TFL_S1102_desc: "To the east are the ruins of Ponyville. Though the town was destroyed, we have reason to believe that that old town library still stands. If we could get to it and find even a handful of useful books, there is no telling what we could learn. After all, the element of magic herself called it home once upon a time. But those were in much more harmonic times."
    TFL_S1102_cett: "If the raid is §Gsuccessful§! §Yseveral technology bonuses§! will be §Gawarded§!. §OYou get one chance at the raid§!."
    TFL_ponyville_raid: "Raid Ponyville"
     TFL_ponyville_raid_desc: "Within the ruins of ponyville lies the ponyville library. If we are able to get inside we will be able to access it's information. Should we be successful we may acheive a great boon from that contained within. With the strange goins on inside, we will only get one chance at this."
     TFL_ES.110200.t: "Knowledge Acquired"
      TFL_ES.110200.d: "Our raid was largely successful and we managed to gather a large assortment of texts and manuscripts from the Ponyville Library. While we weren't able to grab everything we are sure it will no doubt be helpful to us."
      TFL_ES.110200.a: "Knowledge if power. Use it well."
     TFL_ES.110201.t: "Knowledge Aflame"
      TFL_ES.110201.d: "At first the raid was going rather well as our squads entered the library. After a while however they were beseiged by a group of spell-happy inquisitors who were none too pleased to see us. Realizing they were about to be surrounded, the raiders set the library aflame and escaped into the night. The inquisitors seemed far too busy trying to put out the flames to follow them. While this will ensure we will never be able to retrieve what we had sought ever again, our troops managed to escape certain death."
      TFL_ES.110201.a: "It had to be done."
     TFL_ES.110202.t: "Artifacts Stolen"
      TFL_ES.110202.d: "Lasst night a band of raiders broke and entered into the Ponyville Library, snatching a great deal of artifacts from right under our noses. Before we even had a chance to respond they had absconded with a large collection of books."
      TFL_ES.110202.a: "Blasted thieves!"
     TFL_ES.110203.t: "Artifacts Burned"
      TFL_ES.110203.d: "Last night we had a few raiders in the Ponyville Library. While they were driven off with a great deal of effort, they set the library aflame behind them which we had to contain. We will never find out where they came from nor what they sought. A great deal of the artifacts within have been saved, but a sizable section has suffered irreparable damage."
      TFL_ES.110203.a: "A great loss"
   TFL_S1103: "Repaying Them For Their Kindness"
    TFL_S1103_desc: "What those rock tossing farmers to our south have done for us is immeasurable. Many of us are unsure of how we could repay them, or if we ever really could. Many of us have come to a decision that we must at least try though. They helped us in our darkest times, and when the time comes we will aid them in theirs."
   TFL_S1200: "Bracing For The Inevitable"
    TFL_S1200_desc: "It is only a matter of time before Earthborn and its lackeys come beating down our doors. If not all of the clans, then at least Hoofington will for sure. The time has come to bide our time, muster what we can, and prepare for an attack. While we can we must brace for the day we all know will come."
    TFL_preparing_inevitable: "Preparing for the Inevitable"
     TFL_preparing_inevitable_desc: "We have made efforts to prepare for the inevitable assault on our new home. We've begun to erect fortifications, dig trenches, and lay traps. If the forces of Earthborn come knocking, we will be ready for them."
   TFL_S1201: "Striking Back Against Those Who Left Us"
    TFL_S1201_desc: "When we were served under the banner of Earthborn, we were sent to these lands to stabilize by Hoofington. And when our backs were against the wall up here, they left us to die. It is time that those who left us for dead feel the wrath of the ponies they abandoned. For all our fallen brothers and sisters, we charge headlong into war."
    TFL_vengence: "War of Vengence"
     TFL_vengence_desc: "The time has come for our vengence to be visited upon those who left us out here to die and any who may join them. Long has their punishment been overdue. We will drive like a knife through their lines, their reserves, and their defenses to bring frontier justice to the rotten hearts whom abandoned us. Strike now and let them know we are coming for them."
