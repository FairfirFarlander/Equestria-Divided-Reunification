###Ideas###
HEB_idea:"We are Equestria!"
 HEB_idea_desc:"The militaristic regime of House Earthborn has no equals when it comes to pure, brutal strength and unbroken will. Years of harsh training and intense indoctrination have turned a herd of farmers into a relentless war machine that will not stop until all orders of Applejack the Ever-vigilant are fulfilled. Not unlike the legendary behemoths of old - once set in motion, there is no force in this world that can stop the thundering of their hooves. Unstoppable as an avalanche, destructive as an earthquake, unyeilding as a mountain - the behemoth of Equestria has awoken and is ready to crush its enemies."
