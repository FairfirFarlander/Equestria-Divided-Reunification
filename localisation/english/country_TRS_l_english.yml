    EAW_WS_TRS_desc: "The great mountains of Neighgra bore witness to some of the most intense fighting during the second Crystalen War. Now this blood soaked land is a new nation, held together by little more than stubbornness of a dying royal line and the influence of Canterlot. When Canterlot went on its many conquests, the dying thestral clans of the area swore their loyalty to Canterlot in the hopes that they would gain some semblance of their old power over the land. Led by the few nobility left amongst them, the ever shrinking thestral force marched alongside Canterlot. Bringing with them a unyielding fury built out of desperation for survival. Once order was brought to the region and the dust of war settled, Canterlot granted the thestral’s their request. A new nation was to be formed, the Duchy Of Trotsylvania. However, this gift from the old capital came at a cost. This new thestral kingdom was to be little more than a satellite state for Canterlot, its word is law in these lands. However, the mare who sits upon the Trotsylvanian throne has plans to possibly change that. She wishes to see the lands of her forbearers return to some symbol of greatness; to maybe be seen as worthy enough to be compared to the old clans or possibly seen as an equal to Canterlot. But a long road lies ahead of her. Will she be able to lead this relic of a nation through these dark and modern times? Only time may tell what fate has in store for this mysterious dutches and her shell of a kingdom."

Her almost ghostly white fur and red eyes either bewitching or terrifying any who gaze upon her. Until recent years very few ponies outside of the nobility had seen her often. However, things have changed. After she and her small collection of guards ponies sided with Canterlot during their invasion into the region, she finds herself in control. With the blessings of Canterlot the duchess plans on reclaiming the glory of what is left of her small clan. However, being the last of her royal line and the thestral population declining in the region with each passing day, she will have to work hard to achieve her goals. But just what are the goals of this mysterious mare and will they lead her down a path that will put her at odds with Canterlot?"

   TRS_S00: "Securing My Birthright"
    TRS_S00_desc: "Though I may have the backing of Canterlot, my claim to the throne is a shaky one. Without the backing of the nobility I risk them rebelling. However, if I were to persuade enough of them to my side, the rest will have no choice but to follow suit."
   TRS_S01A: "Convening with the Lower Houses"
    TRS_S01A_desc: "The majority of the noble families that are left in these lands belong to the lower classes. Although they hold little power, their loyalty still matters in the end. Perhaps with a bit of time and some work I can secure their loyalty."
    TRS_ES.0001.t: "The Lower Houses Show Their Support"
     TRS_ES.0001.d: "The lower rungs of the noble class were actually persuaded fairly easily. What surprised me the most is that despite most of them knowing the circumstances of my birth, many of them seemed willing to show open support for my claim to the throne.\n\nThey all seem to have their own reasonings for doing so. Most of them seem willing to back my claims for simply having the support of the militias and guards no matter my ties to any blood lines. Others seem to want nothing more than to have someone in charge who is not tied to the high nobility or their companies.\n\nThere are a few of them who talked about the memories they had of the days when my mother ruled these lands. Despite being old and gray, their failing minds still remember seeing that shy, red eyed filly who was always hiding under her wings.\n\nThey believe it to be my birthright to rule as I am the only living heir left who is not some distant relative to the former duchess."
     TRS_ES.0001.a: "May their support not be in vain."
     TRS_ES.0001.r: "§gLegacy Credit Option.\nSee Credits for Details.§!"
   TRS_S01B: "A Gathering of the High Nobility"
    TRS_S01B_desc: "The high nobility, the ten most powerful families in all of the duchy. Each and every single one of them are not to be trifled with. Their blood lines are as old as my own, and many doubt if their coin purses even have a bottom. All of them hold some powerful business within these borders or have a tie to my own line. Their loyalty means more than anything else if I am to actually have any kind of legitimacy."
    TRS_ES.0101.t: "A Grand Feast"
     TRS_ES.0101.d: "Traditionally speaking, when the loyalty of the high nobility was in question, a grand feast was to be held in their honor so that matters of concern could be discussed with them. I am not one to break with such a tradition, and neither is the high nobility. I believe that the time has come for one of those great feasts to happen once again. I will fetch a scribe and have him send out letters and invitations to each of them. Hopefully they will respond well and actually show up to the gathering. I know they have looked down upon me and the claim I had to the throne for many years due to me being born out of wedlock. But hopefully I will be able to change their minds and secure the loyalty of at least a few of them."
   TRS_ES.0101.a: "The Time of the feast grows nearer."
    TRS_ES.0102.t: "The Gathering of the High Nobility"
     TRS_ES.0102.d: "The day of the grand feast had finally arrived.  Members of the high nobility slowly showed up to the castle gates throughout the day. All the way up to until the hour before dinner would be served. I had spent as much time as I could with as many of them as I could. Trying my best to butter them up enough to persuade them to back my claim to the throne. Some of their minds were easy enough to sway in my favor, Needing only to see and hear my plans for the duchy laid out before them. Others needed only to see that others had already begun to back my claim. But as is the nature of things, a few of them required much more. In the end deals had to be made, bridges were built, and grand gifts were divided out amongst those who still needed persuading. By the end of the night a majority of the high nobility were willing to show support for my claim."
     TRS_ES.0102.a: "That is apart from one..."
    TRS_ES.0103.t: "Her Lavender Eminence"
     TRS_ES.0103.d: "Glisoning Marble, The matriarch of one of the oldest families in these lands has refused to back my claim. No matter what I offered to her or her kin she refuses to be persuaded. I should have figured as much. I have heard tales that she had been eyeing the throne ever since she was a filly herself. She was always told that she would be the only legitimate heir left after my sister passed away. That is until she learned of me. The last true heir… She has hated me ever since she learned of my very existence all those years ago... Even now, while being old and gray and having one hoof in the grave, she is still dead set on letting no one else have the throne but herself. That is why it has sat empty for so many years… Neither of our claims amounted to anything since neither of us could get enough backing.\n\nBut there is something else to her opposition this time. Something within her eyes tells me that there is another reason she wishes for me not to sit upon that throne. Could she possibly know of my...? No that should not be. Whatever it may be, it matters little. That throne has sat empty for far too long, to the point that we are losing sight of who we are and once were. And with enough of the high nobility backing my claim, there is little that she can do now. However, it is safe to assume that she will stop at nothing to block my way at every turn that she can."
     TRS_ES.0103.a: "She may prove to be a dangerous rival."
   TRS_S02: "The Crowning of Lady Aurora"
    TRS_S02_desc: "With the loyalty of the nobility secured I can finally take my rightful place upon the throne of my ancestors. If only my mother could have seen this day. She would have been so proud of her little filly."
    TRS_ES.0201.t: "The Crowning of Aurora"
     TRS_ES.0201.d: "Aurora stood upon her balcony watching as members of the noble families made their was into the castle. A gentle sigh would leave her lips as she turned her gaze up at the night sky above her. She watched as the moon and glimmering stars shined brightly overhead. The sight of it all filled her heart with a sense of childlike wonderment for a moment before she would hear a knock at her chamber doors. Turning her gaze back towards the door she would see a old maid standing there. A gentle smile on her wrinkled face.\n\n"The time has finally come my dear. Are you ready to sit where your mother and sister sat before you?"\n\nThe old mare’s words would cause Aurora to smile a little at herself.\n"I am Miss Tensile, but I would like for you to accompany me to the ceremony. It would feel odd not having you there to witness it all."\n\nThe old mare would simply nod and step aside waiting by the door as Aurora dawned her hat and walked out the door.  The sounds of music and conversation filled the halls of the castle as the two mares walked side by side."
     TRS_ES.0201.a: "§LContinue...§!"
    TRS_ES.0202.t: "The Crowning of Aurora"
     TRS_ES.0202.d: ""Your mother and sister would both be so proud of you my dear. If only they could see you now. I was genuinely worried that I may not have been able to see it myself, but here you are!"\n\nTensal’s words cause the smile to never leave Aurora’s face. The towering mare only cutting off the old mare’s sting of kind words with some of her own. "Miss Tensile you have been like a mother to me all of these years. Treated me as if I was your own when so few others cared. If it was not for you and those old members of the guard pushing me along, I fear that I may have stayed as little more than a soul who haunts these halls. I am so very thankful that some of you can witness this day, but I feel like all of those who can not are still watching. I just hope that they are all proud despite the things I had to do."\n\n"They are my dear, do not even begin to think otherwise.""
     TRS_ES.0202.a: "§LContinue...§!"
    TRS_ES.0203.t: "The Crowning of Aurora"
     TRS_ES.0203.d: "The two of them had finally reached the doors to the throne room of the castle. There They were greeted by an old stallion in armor with a group of guard ponies behind him. A prideful smile was painted across the old thestral’s face as he stood at attention.\n\n"Ready to escort you inside Madam Duchess!"\n\nAurora would just roller her eyes and chuckle a little at the old guard’s words.\n"You never have changed Radigues you old walking tin can.  Always formal and proper even when I have told you in the past to not be."\n\n"It is only proper Aurora. Now let’s get you inside, all of us have been waiting far too long to see someone take that throne once again."\n\nWith that the guard ponies opened the doors to the throne room and began to march inside. Aurora, Tensile, and Radiguss following close behind them through the crowd of nobles. As they reached the throne, Lady Aurora would slowly turn to face the crowd of ponies behind her. Gazing out upon them as she slowly sat upon the throne. As she did, a voice rang out from somewhere within the crowd, followed by another, and then another until the whole room had erupted in the same chant."
     TRS_ES.0203.a: "Hail Lady Aurora, Hail to our new duchess!"
   TRS_S03A: "The Return of the Royal Knights"
    TRS_S03A_desc: "Even before my time the royal guard that surrounded my family had begun to shrink and struggle. I can see it in the eyes of the few royal knights that are left in the duchy. They all wish to be a part of the once mighty silver army of their forefathers instead of this shell of a force who guards this castle. I believe that with a little persuasion and work with the nobility, the  could see a return of the royal knights."

   TRS_S03C: "Opening Up to the Rest Of Moon and Star"
    TRS_S03C_desc: "It is clear that we no longer live in the times where a nation could simply close it’s borders to the outside and be self sufficient. Especially with a city like Canterlot looming over one’s shoulder. Whether we want to or not we are going to have to open up to the outside. I must keep my chin up though. After all who knows, maybe we will be able to bring things into this duchy we could have only dreamed off."

The other is Red land filled with brainwashed workers who are willing to die for a corrupted form of equality. I can feel the tension in the air. I know war will soon be coming, but from which I do not know. All I can do is prepare my duchy the best I can for what may come."

    TRS_ES.0501.t: "The Inquisition Comes to the Duchy"
     TRS_ES.0501.d: "During an evening gathering of the nobility, a member of the guard rushes to the side of Duchess Aurora. Aurora would give the mare a strange look before realizing the panicked look on her face. The guard would try to speak through her pants as she tried to catch her breath.\n\n"Madam Duchess. Forgive the intrusion but I came to inform you that two dignitaries from Canterlot have come. They are demanding an immediate audience with you."\n\nJust as the word leaves the guards lips, two stallions come into the room. Pushing past the nobility and servants in their way, until they came face to face with Aurora. There was something strange the way they looked. One was draped in a long hooded purple cloak that covered his eyes. The other was dressed in a rather fine looked purple coat and sash.\n\nWhat truly struck her about their appearance were the metal crests adorning their clothing. However once she saw them, her blood ran cold. Aurora realized that standing before her were two members of Moon and Star's inquisitorial force. Her heart began to beat faster and faster as they came closer to her throne. Hiding her nervousness the best she could, she stood to great the two of them with a gentle smile."

     TRS_ES.0502.d: ""Gentlecolts, what brings you to my little duchy on this day? I hope your journey here was rather pleasant?"\n\nThe duchess would ask. The much younger looking stallion opened his mouth to speak, but was quickly cut off by the hooded figure next to him, as a spark of magic kept around their horn with an audible crack-like sound. Drawing the attention of every pony within the room.\n\n"We were sent here by order of Canterlot and the Inquisition of Moon and Star. We are here to ensure that the laws of Canterlot are being followed to the letter and to aid in the fight against any possible... uprisings or troubles that may be occurring within the region. You may address us as Inquisitors Phantasm and Swirl respectively."\nThere was an odd bluntness to the stallion's words that almost made them seem as if they were filled with a sort of diatain.\n\n"With all due respect, there is no need for members of the Inquisition to come to my little duchy. I can assure you that everything is under complete-"\n\nAurora's words were cut off by the sudden glare from the hooded figure.\n\n"It is of no difference to me what you believe. We were given orders to come here, and we will be staying here until we see it as fit for us to take our leave.""

    TRS_ES.0503.t: "The Inquisition Comes to the Duchy"
     TRS_ES.0503.d: "The room went silent as an uneasy tension filled the air. Aurora and the inquisitor would stare one another down. This would continue until the duchess would clear her throat, and speak once again.\n\n"Well then... by all means. Stay as long as you seem fit, but I know my lands and my ponies' loyalty well. There is no risk of rebellion or whatever it is you are searching for. Now guards. Please see to it that these two have lodging for this evening. They will be staying within the south tower."\n\nWith that the two Inquisitors found themselves flanked by two armored ponies, before they were escorted out of the throne room and to their new quarters. Once they were gone the nobility that surrounded the room began to whisper and murmur. Fearful of what may come off all of this. That is until Aurora stood from her throne and addressed the ponies around her.\n\n"Brothers and sisters, do not let the words of some ragged looking unicorn worry you. I can assure you that it will pose no threat to our way of life. If they end up being so I will see to it personally that they are taken care of. We have worked hard to retain what we have and we will not let some inquisition take it from us."\n\nWith that, the room erupted in cheers and chants of praise from the nobility."

   TRS_S06A: "A Meeting With Inquisitor Swirl"
    TRS_S06A_desc: "Inquisitor Swirl seems to be much more approachable than many other members of his organization I have come across. So much so, that I cannot help but assume that he is putting on some kind of character. Regardless of what I think, a little meeting with this strange stallion is in order. After all, if I must work with him, it is better that I know a little bit more about him or why he is truly here. Perhaps a small dinner?"
    TRS_ES.0601.t: "A Meeting With Inquisitor Swirl"
     TRS_ES.0601.d: "After a few days of consideration and planning, Duchess Aurora had a small message sent to Inquisitor Swirl. Summoning him for a small banquet in the castle's dining hall. She now finds herself alone with him at a dining table. The two of them discuss over a bottle of wine, as the castle's servants prepare their meal.\n\n"So tell me Inquisitor Swirl. Why is it that you and that other stallion were sent out here? Surely it can not be because they truly think there is a risk of rebellion from me or my ponies?"\n\nShe would ask as the stallion across from her slowly swirled the wine in his glass.\n\n"Please. Just call me Cotton or Cotton Swirl. Never was one for all the fancy titles."\n\nHis odd reply confused Aurora, causing her to tilt her head in a bit of surprise and confusion. An inquisitor who is so informal? Now that did interest her."

     TRS_ES.0602.d: ""Now if you want honesty and truth, I can not really offer you much of either. You see I was sent here with Inquisitor Phantasm for a few different reasons. One of those being that others flat out refuse to go anywhere with him. See the Inquisition prefers to send two members out together on tasks. I just happened to draw the short straw and had to accompany them on this task."\n\nBefore Aurora could say anything a servant comes into the room, carrying a silver platter filled with a mixture of rather fine foods. Nothing as fancy as you would find in Canterlot, but that did not seem to bother the Inquisitor. In fact it almost seemed like he was quite astonished with what had been laid before him. The two of them would continue to chat about things well into the night. Both of them seem to genuinely enjoy one another's company. As dinner finally wined down though, Cotton Swirl would offer Aurora a few parting words as he stood up from the table.\n\n"Tonight was truly a lovely night, but I must turn it in. I have a lot of work to do tomorrow, but before I do a bit of advice for you, your highness. Mind yourself around Phantasm. He is uh... well let's just say he is not a stallion to trifle with. Stay on his good side - if he even has one."\n\nAurora would give a little nod before Cotton would turn to leave. But before he could close the door behind him, Aurora would call out to him with a small smile.\n\n"You are right this was a nice evening, let us do it again sometime.""
     TRS_ES.0602.a: "A pleasant evening."
   TRS_S06B: "A Meeting with Inquisitor Phantasm"
    TRS_S06B_desc: "This Mystical Phantasm does not seem like any of the other members of Canterlot’s bureaucracy or Inquisition I have come across. He comes off as more of an outcast to me. Perhaps after a little sit down I can discover why he was sent here, or at least why he acts so strange."
    TRS_ES.0603.t: "A Meeting with Inquisitor Phantasm"
     TRS_ES.0603.d: "Aurora found herself sitting alone in the castle’s gardens awaiting the arrival of Inquisitor Phantasm. She had been waiting so long that the tea brewed for the meeting between the two had become cold. Becoming rather bored during her wait, she found herself gazing up and the stars overhead. Recalling old memories of better times, that is until she caught a small glimpse of the other Inquisitor, Cotton Swirl, down the hill in the castle’s small orchard.  She watched him for a moment as he seemed to be trying to get an apple out of one of the trees. He would buck the tree over and over, but nothing would come out. That is until one apple would fall and knock him in the head and causing him to pass out. See this, Aurora would chuckle, but would quickly silence herself as she heard footsteps approaching. She could feel a chill running down her spin as a familiar gaze fell upon her.\n\n"Your late Inquisitor Phantasm, our tea has long since gone cold. I summoned you for this meeting hours ago."\nThe duchess would say as the hoofsteps got closer and closer, until they came to a stop beside her.\n\n"Forgive me, but you misunderstand fair Duchess, I do not come about at your beck and call. You see that is what you do for Canterlot and by extension myself. You are lucky that I even came to this little tea party of yours. I am a busy stallion and have little time to waste on mares playing princess.""

Taking in a long, deep breath, She opened her breath to respond before being cut off by a glow of magic sparked wildly around his horn.\n\n"Before you speak another word, I want you to understand a few things, your highness. I was only sent out here with that other fool to ensure that the laws and ideas of Canterlot and the Princesses are being followed and enforced. However, just from my short time here I can already see and feel the sin and vice  It is seeping from every pour and crevice imaginable out here. Since you fail to see it and tend to it, it is my duty to strike it all down before it has any chance to blossom into things we cannot contain or control. Consider my deeds going forward as a gift from the Inquisition for aiding Canterlot in the retaking of the region. Now, if you will excuse me, I have no time for a moonlit tea party. I have a lot of work to attend to."\n\nWith that Phantasm turns and begins to leave. Aurora’s eyes would follow him until he vanished into the castle once more. Now alone in the guards once again, she would turn her gaze back to the stars as a heavy sigh left her lips."

    TRS_M02B_desc: "We must embrace the ideas of the modern world just a little if we plan on surviving it. Even if it causes our ancestors to turn in their graves. Open the ranks of the knights to the commoner. Perhaps they may surprise us all."
   TRS_M03A: "The Duchess's Mountaineers"
    TRS_M03A_desc: "Since we are surrounded by mountains, we should have ponies within our ranks who specialize with such terrain. They could very well end up being the backbones of our defense, or the tips of our spear."
   TRS_M03B: "A More Specialized Form of Cannon"
    TRS_M03B_desc: "Transporting our cannons through the steep and twisting valleys of our mountains has proven to be rather challenging. We need to find a solution before we lose more equipment or worse soldiers. Rumor has it a cannon crew modified their gun to make it easier to transport. If these rumors are true, it could lead to whole new designs and uses. We must track them down and have them summoned here at once."
   TRS_M03C: "The Weapons of Canterlot, Now Our Own"
    TRS_M03C_desc: "Those magical weapons Canterlot use to flaunt their power and magical might may soon be ours as well. We have obtained a little information about a shipment going to a garrison in the north.  Perhaps we could intercept it and claim them for our own. If we did, we could use a few of them for study. Craft a design of our own."
   TRS_M04C: "To Prepare For What We All Know Will Come"
    TRS_M04C_desc: "It is inevitable that our mountains will once again see war. No matter if it is the Crystal Empire, The Revolutionaries, or Canterlot who starts it; we will be dragged into it. All we can do is prepare. We must build fortifications in the mountains, which may bankrupt us. But if it means the preservation of my line and less of my subjects being little more then corpses to decorate the mountainside, it will be worth it."
    TRS_M04C_effect_tooltip: "A §gBunkers§! line will be built on the original northern border of §Y[ROOT.GetNameDef]§!."
   TRS_M04D: "The March To Baicall"
    TRS_M04D_desc: "Our forebears once laid claim to lands in the north. Lands now controlled by those fools who cloak themselves in red. By the hooves of our brave soldiers we will make good on those claims and take those lands from their filthy red clutches!"

   TRS_I00: "Improving The Farms Of Trotterfield"
    TRS_I00_desc: "We are truly blessed to have such fertile farmland at our disposal. I believe we could feed all of Canterlot with how much we could grow. However, the nobility who own the land say it is not developed enough to produce more grain then it already does. I will have a few advisers talk directly to the peasants and farmers themselves. They should know better about farming than the fat old fools who do nothing but collect their share of the crop."
   TRS_I01: "Industrializing The Duchy"
    TRS_I01_desc: "Idle hooves are the play things of Tarderous, especially if those hooves belong to the peasantry and foolish nobility. Therefore we must put those hooves to work. My little dutchy is in need of new factories, and we have no lack of workers. I am sure some of the nobles can be persuaded to invest in a few factories if it means they get to boss the workers around."
   TRS_I0: "A More Self Reliant Trotsylvania"
    TRS_I0_desc: "We can not always depend on our allies to supply us with the goods we need. We must become more self reliant. Some of the nobility believe that they could get a steel mill up and another believes he may be able to help up make these things he calls synthetics. Let us hope they will actually produce results and these are not just hollow promises to get on my good side."
   TRS_I0: "Tapping Into The Mountains"
    TRS_I0_desc: "Our homeland is filled with mountains and cliffs, and all of them are ripe for the picking. Rumor has it that there are veins of ore and crystals running all throughout them. A survey team will be sent out to see if these rumors are true."
   TRS_I0: "The Great Watery Gateway"
    TRS_I0_desc: "The waterways of these lands offer us a chance to trade and transport our goods much farther and quicker. Even to areas outside of Canterlot's reach. If so we may be able to import resources and tools from the outside to help us build. All we need is a little time and some river boats."
   TRS_I0: "A New Use For A Family Relic"
    TRS_I0_desc: "Everything passed down to me I hold dear and treasure.  However, I am willing to sacrifice almost all of it if it means this kingdom can return to its former glory. One such thing is the old airship my family used to use to travel. It will serve us better in a military or trading role. Mother forgive me for using our possessions in such a way."
   TRS_I0: "A New Opportunity For The Nobility"
    TRS_I0_desc: "Some of these nobility still have a few old pleasure airships floating to their names. Perhaps we could entice them to use them to benefit us and themselves by using them for trade?"
   TRS_I0: "Rekindling Old Ties"
    TRS_I0_desc: "There are other clans and gatherings of thestrals out there, are there not? If so we could possibly start working or trading with them. Send out one of the airships on a quest to the south. If the ancient city still stands, then we can maybe begin kindling a sort of partnership."
   TRS_I0: "A More Modern Way of Learning"
    TRS_I0_desc: "Though many will say this comes at a risk to our way of life, we must be willing to progress in some ways. Education will help us not just survive, but thrive. A new university will be opened here on the castle grounds. Hopefully, with access to a proper library and such history, the ponies of this duchy could learn a few things."

   TRS_melee_equipment_0_desc: "Whilst Equestria at large has been plunged into the era of the rifle, Trosylvania holds fast to the era of cold steel with it's assortment of halberds, blades, shields, and crossbows. With the conclusion of the Crystal War and it's aftermath the retirement of this generation of weaponry becomes an ever looming possibility. These tools remain staples of hunting hostile creatures and local bandits. efforts are being made to adapt this beloved weaponry into the modern era."
