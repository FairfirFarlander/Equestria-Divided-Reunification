 EAW_WS_EMB:"The Communes of Ember - The Children of the First Queen"
  EAW_WS_EMB_desc:"It is nothing odd for one or even small collections of changelings to leave the changeling lands.  Whether it was to fleed, conquer new lands, or to even flee the tyranny of their homelands.  Many brave changelings have made the long journey across the continent.  The ones who make up this small little commune are no different.  No one seems to really know what hive they came from originally, or when they exactly came to the southern jungles.  What was known of them before the Great Dividing, portrayed them as a rather peaceful group of changelings.  As a group who partook in magic and ideas that were not so welcomed in the Changeling Lands.  They rarely left the jungles they called home.  So fairly few actually know about their existence.  Those who did know of them knew very little.  It was known that they had at least two villages deep within the jungle.  However no one seemed to be able to figure out just how large these villages were or where they were.  It was also known that they would trade potions to the neighboring towns for supplies.  Their skills in alchemy helped to drive away many sicknesses in the region.\n\nAs Equestria began to fall into dark clutches of chaos, this group of changelings found themselves surrounded by madness as Equestria began to fracture.  The changelings wanted to help those around them and began traveling to some of the nearby towns more frequently rendering what medical aid they could.  Riots continued to rage, becoming more and more violent in the towns and cities surrounding them.  Many of the leaders in the commune began to fear the worst was to come soon, and ordered the villages to be fortified and expanded.  However, they knew the task would not be easy.  Then an idea came to the idea of one of the oldest drones of the commune’s leadership.\n\nThese changelings had dug out and already had been using underground tunnels for traversing the jungles.  A safe underway passage to avoid the dangers and heat of the jungle.  Knowing this, and weighing their options the village leaders gave the order.  Mass construction efforts were undertaken to ensure the safety of those who called the commune home.  The tunnels were quickly expanded as Equestria began to divide into smaller nations.  The villages of the commune were moved into the tunnels, which quickly were becoming larger and larger by the day.  They worked with a religious fervor. They carved new homes, roads, and eventually whole new villages into the stone of the tunnels.  This new life in the underways may help them in the short term, but the leaders of the commune know the surrounding nations may very well come for them.  They will have to fortify even more, and even lash out if need be.  The question is, who will be the leaders to lead them through the coming storms?"

EMB_S00:"Dealing with the Outside"
 EMB_S00_desc:"In the years since the rulers of the ponies vanished this land has become a more brutal and unforgiving place by the day. In the past we were content with hiding within the jungle, but these dark times force us to act to protect our commune. The Council of Ember will be gathering in the coming week to decide on how our drones will be kept safe from surface dwellers and their wars."
 EMB_evt_a01.001.t:"Gathering Council of Ember"
  EMB_evt_a01.001.d:"This week the 300 members of the council will be gathering within the hallowed halls of the Council Palace. Under the supervision of Head Councilor Tyrennadus, leaders of all the unions within the Communes of Ember will be discussing and voting on how our communities will face these dark times. Queen Narratek in a rare act that has surprised many, will be sitting in on these discussions and voicing any concerns she has. Some members of the council have voiced their concern about the queen even entering the halls of the council, but many still welcome her opinions during these trying times."

 EMB_S01A:"Shutting Ourselves Away"
  EMB_S01A_desc:"In better times we would use our alchemical knowledge and rare plants to make medicines to trade with the pony villages around us. In more recent times however our traders have been met with hostility and robbery while on their routes. It is the opinion of the council that all trade with the outside is brought to a halt. Our neighbors may not be fond of this, but we must protect our caravans."
   EMB_evt_a01.011.t:"Backlash from the Caravan Unions"
    EMB_evt_a01.011.d:"After hours of deliberation and discussion Tyrennadus has swung the gavel down on the first motion the council hopes will protect Ember and our surrounding communes. Effective immediately all trade with the outside world is prohibited under the threat of arrest and seizure of goods. Many within the farming and trading unions and even the queen herself voiced major concerns about the motion, but neither of the unions who voiced concerns had the votes to counter the motion."

 EMB_S01B:"The Underway Awaits!"
  EMB_S01B_desc:"There have always been those of us in the communes who wished to live and bask in the sun as most of us moved underground. However, it has become apparent that the villages above the Underway are no longer safe. It is time to begin moving the members of the communes still above ground down into the Underway. The drones of the surface will understand why they must abandon their homes for new ones underground with the rest of us."
  EMB_evt_a01.012.t:"Dark News for the Surface"
   EMB_evt_a01.012.d:"Not a soul of the council had left the council building for days. Many thought that they had been working on motions that would cause drastic changes to the communes. What little we did know came from passing comments of the staff of council members. Now what they have been deliberating on has been announced. With the swing of a gavel, it has been ordered that all remaining drones on the surface of the communes will be moved into the Underway. All drones are to be given 3 weeks to gather belongings and prepare for their movement. After the motion was passed members of the farming unions were in an uproar. Some members of the council stated that they saw a rare burst of anger coming from the Queen of our communes and hive. Speaking with such anger and passion that it seemed like venom lacing every word she spoke. Regardless of her and the farming unions' protests, the motion passed 250 to 50."
   EMB_evt_a01.012.a:"Safety Comes First."
  EMB_evt_a01.013.t:"The Great Movement Underground"
   EMB_evt_a01.013.d:"The mass movement of those who were still on the surface began today. Many had protested being moved from their farms and villages on the surface. But with the aid of the commune malitas, most if not all have been brought into the safety of the underground. The Church of The First Queen is offering temporary shelter to those moved underground while the mining and labor unions are more than willing to offer new jobs and positions to all affected by the move."
   EMB_evt_a01.013.a:"We welcome our new neighbors."
   EMB_evt_a01.013.h:"§gDebug§!: §RRemove 5000§! manpower.\n§GAdd 50§! political power."
 EMB_S01C:"A Future Completely Underground"
  EMB_S01C_desc:"The Underway could be the key to surviving the chaos above all of our heads. However many are uncertain about how we should proceed forward. Others feel as if things may very well come to a head within the Underway as the chaos above will trickle down to us. No matter though, the council shall continue deliberations as they should for the glory and safety of Ember!"
  EMB_evt_a01.014.t:"A Walkout"
   EMB_evt_a01.014.d:"Deliberations on the future of Ember continue as the final drones from the great movement is brought into the Underway. Queen Narratek has decided to return to her palace on the outskirts of the commune after the mass movement motion was passed. The council chose to not see her off and continued their deliberations. There is a growing rumor and worry that the council will continue these important sessions without the advice of her highness. However the council leader and head Tyrennadus continues to assure the drones of the Underway that they are only doing these motions to protect the commune from the chaos of the surface."

 EMB_S02A:"A Royal Idea"
  EMB_S02A_desc:"Messengers and criers were sent out from the palace of her highness Queen Narratek, announcing that the royal gardens of her palace will be expanded. She has hopes that in times of need these expansions could help supply a little extra food to Ember. Although the council has come out against such an expansion to the palace, they have little to no authority over royal palace grounds."
  EMB_evt_a01.021.t:"The Architect"
   EMB_evt_a01.021.d:"The question is now how will her highness expand the gardens and what will grow there?"   #Expand the event later to include the architect.
   EMB_evt_a01.021.a:"Sow the seeds of grain. We shall use it for bread to give to the masses."
   EMB_evt_a01.021.b:"Sow the seeds of plants from the jungle. We shall grow them for medicine to help the sick."

 EMB_S02B:"An Alchemcial Idea"
  EMB_S02B_desc:"A messenger from the Temple of the First Queen came to the halls of the council palace carrying plans and a message from the church. The clergy of the temple believe that they have an alchemical way to help the drones of the commune with the darkness of the Underway. They are requesting resources to help with this endeavor of theirs, but is it worth providing them?"
  EMB_evt_a01.022.t:"To Whom the Task Lies"
   EMB_evt_a01.022.d:"The question remains. How do we respond?"
   EMB_evt_a01.022.a:"The alchemists have their ideas. Adapt their plan and have the engineers work on a solution!"
   EMB_evt_a01.022.b:"We will grant the alchemists of the church resources, but we expect results."
  EMB_evt_a01.023.t:"A Twisted Natural Light"
   EMB_evt_a01.023.d:"Members of the clergy unveiled something of wonder during their latest gathering. An odd glass like crystal they had contained within a glass jar. The odd crystal softly glowed. Filling the area around it with a soft greenish blue hue of light. They presented it as a sort of new light for the underway’s streets and homes. Members of the council, especially those from the scientist and engineering unions, are calling this development mad sciences and quite possibly unsafe. Despite the councils apprehensions many drones are praising the creation of these glowing crystals and are wanting to have them brought into their homes. Some of these crystals have even replaced the candles and torches lighting the area around the temple. It is expected that many of the old candle lanterns will be replace with lanterns containing these crystals over the next few years."
   EMB_evt_a01.023.a:"Good."

  EMB_evt_a01.024.t:"Power of the Underground"
   EMB_evt_a01.024.d:"Drones gathered around the council palace as a few members of the engineering unions announced that they had revived the idea of a machine that would provide light to Ember. The machine that they unveiled was a smaller version of a massive machine they were currently constructing in the deepest parts of the underway. A machine that roared to life with a spark of fire and a bit of coal. The council looked on in amazement as the machine began to power a crude bulb that engineers had made. The engineering union member pledged that the core of Ember, the council palace, would be lit up by the orange glow of bulbs. The rest of the city would soon follow over the coming months."
   EMB_evt_a01.024.a:"Good."
   EMB_evt_a01.024.h:"§gDebug§!: §RRevert§! party popularities."
 EMB_S03:"The Costs of Safety"
  EMB_S03_desc:"Council Leader Tyrennadus has called for a special session of the council to be formed this week. No one seems to know what this meeting will be about. However, the council leader continues to assure the communes that the gathering is only to discuss the plans for the upcoming festivals held in the city center in the coming months."
  EMB_evt_a01.031.t:"A Special Session"
   EMB_evt_a01.031.d:"Members of the council, this information does not leave this room. What am I about to say does not leave these halls. The communes of Ember and the council are about to face trials and hardships we have not faced since when we first fled our fatherland. I and members of the writers unions have been trying to keep a lid on things, but we are going to be facing shortages. Shortages on everything from food to housing. It is also becoming clearer by the day that the drones of these communes are beginning to believe the council is leading them down the wrong path. But all we have done was for the greater good of Ember. There are consequences for keeping our communities safe in these dark times. One way or another they will understand."
   EMB_evt_a01.031.a:"So be it."
 EMB_S04A:"The Beginning of Troubles"
  EMB_S04A_desc:"Some members within the communes have been writing in letters to the council palace offices. In these letters drones have been noting some concerns they have been having. Some drones of the smaller villages in the Underway have been writing in complaints and worries about a bread and grain shortage they perceive. Other drones in the lower levels of Ember are also claiming a food shortage as well."
  EMB_evt_a01.041.t:"They are Correct"
   EMB_evt_a01.041.d:"The drones along our outskirts and the lower levels are correct. There are shortages of grain and wheat. However the shortages have been a growing concern for the past couple of months.  We have been going off of the communal reserves since last year’s harvest yielded so little. By removing the farmers from the surface for their safety, we have doubled, maybe even tripled our use of what's left of the reserves. Fellow council members it is the opinion of I, the council leader, that we must find a solution. Thankfully one already exists. In the early days of Ember we baked the dust of trees into our bread so that we would have enough food to go around. For the glory of Ember and its survival, tree flour must be used to feed our communities. When the drones no longer have empty bellies, they will complain little about the taste. Just in case they continue to be unsatisfied and find out about the shortages, have our guard and the militias begin training for unrest."
   EMB_evt_a01.041.a:"Fuzz Fuzz."
 EMB_S04B:"The Cost of No Sun"
  EMB_S04B_desc:"Some of the drones from the surface are beginning to struggle with the loss of the sun in their lives. Some are wishing for the warm glow of the sun again. However, we know it is not safe for them topside. Think of a risk to the communes if just one of them were captured. They could tell those on the surface how to get into the underway. How should we handle those who eagerly wish to return to the surface?"
  EMB_evt_a01.042.t:"Restlessness on the Rise"
   EMB_evt_a01.042.d:"Council members! Our fellow drones from the surface have made clear their intent to disobey the guidance of this very council; to ascend to the surface despite the risk it poses to the communes. These foolish drones may have never witnessed the wars we escaped so long ago and their terrible aftermath. They do not know what is good for themselves or the communes; that all which we toiled long and hard may yet fall to ashes due to their recklessness.\n\nThis session was hereby called to a vote as to how to best deal with this potential crisis. We of the council hereby decalre that those who seek to return to the surface..."
   EMB_evt_a01.042.a:"Can take up the pickaxe to forget their worries."
   EMB_evt_a01.042.b:"May join the ranks of the militia as sentries."
   EMB_evt_a01.042.c:"Will be pacified by the temple's calming ways."
 EMB_S04C:"There is Not Enough Room"
  EMB_S04C_desc:"Those who came from the surface have begun constructing shanty towns across the levels of Ember. Those living within them have started to refer to them as council villages. They are blaming us for their lack of proper housing. We sanctioned space to build more housing for all of them. It takes time to construct that amount of housing."
  EMB_evt_a01.043.t:"The Housing Crisis"
   EMB_evt_a01.043.d:"Many those within the shanty towns have started blaming the council for the growing lack of housing. Do they not understand that? They should be thankful to even be within the safety of the underway. With the rising tensions as of late, we need to take action to deal with the issue. How shall we proceed?"

  EMB_evt_a01.044.t:"Clearing the Council Villages"
   EMB_evt_a01.044.d:"Members of the commune militias began the process of clearing the shanty towns scattered throughout Ember. Council leader Tyrennadus came out with a statement saying that after multiple reports of violent crimes happening within the shanty towns, it was decided that they would be broken up. He went on to promise the writing unions and communal papers a full list of the reported crimes in the following days. There are those calling this an attack on the downtrodden of the communes, but many more believe the words of Tyrennadus and the council. Proclaiming support for the actions taken against those within the shanty towns."

  EMB_evt_a01.051.t:"Mother Nightshade"
   EMB_evt_a01.051.d:"A drone going by the name of Mother Nightshade has been holding cermins and gatherings outside of the temples. She has been going throughout the lower levels of the city spreading her word.  Normally this would not be a problem, but her words seem to have hints of revolution in them. We had ordered a few loyal drones to follow and listen in on a few of her sermons. All of them had reported back that she is a radical. Using the words of her god to twist the minds of our brothers and sisters. Since she has been doing this in the lower levels, there is no telling just how long she has been doing these gatherings nor how many followers she has gained. We must keep an eye on her and prepare for any sort of trouble she may start!"

   EMB_evt_a01.052.d:"The shortages have grown into a problem that can no longer be covered up or simply ignored. Within the next few months our meals will consist of more additives than actual food. There are already letters coming from the lower levels saying that some city sections and villages are starving. The lowest levels have even reported their first deaths due to starvation. We must find a way to stave off starvation for the majority of the communes."
   EMB_evt_a01.052.a:"Begin rationing. Issue stamps where needed."
   #We have no choice, begin rationing the food supplies that we have left. Start issuing stamp cards to track and make sure none are getting more than what they need.

   EMBact01.01.d:"Leaders! The last few weeks have been largely successful. We've moved a number of our communes into the underway. According to our records however some of our kin are unaccounted for. It is time to count heads. We have to make sure that we do not forget anyone above ground."

   EMBact01.03.d:"At last the great migration to our new home has concluded. Celebration has broken out in the tunnels and enclaves. Merry and joy has taken root in our hearts and minds, flowing into the evening with song. Many rowdy songs and speeches are uttered as the festivities wear into the endless night. Perhaps in this paradise we may finally create our underground utopia."

 EMB_S11:"Our Future Underground"

    EMBact01.04.b:"...must resume immediately. Regardless of the cost we must be prepared for anything."
 EMB_S12A:"A Royal Idea"
  EMB_S12A_desc:"It has come to our attention that a few of the commune leaders wish to build a few grand gardens in the underway, like those in our old home land. Normally we would not indulge many of their ideas, but there could be potential here. The gardens could provide us with food and may bring quite a bit of joy to all of us in the Underway. However it will take time for the gardens to grow. Should we pursue this idea?"
   EMBact01.05.t:"The Terraces Are Prepared"
    EMBact01.05.d:"We have dug out the nessesary room to begin planting various plants and vegetation, however there is only so much room as of the moment. Thus the council has deliberated on what to purpose the first terraces of soil for. There are two camps of thought on the matter. One group wishes to plant various vegatables for the coming days to lessen the dangers of potential famine. The other group wishes to plant botanical fauna and flora to lift our spirits during these trying times. Drones within both groups have come to realize perhaps we could meet both means, alloting appropriate space to each purpose. Regardless of the outcome the gardens are prepared for whatever we may end up using them for."

 EMB_S13C:"There Is Not Enough Room!"
  EMB_S13C_desc:"Dear leaders, there is not enough room in the Underway for everyone to move back and forth in the tunnels. We underestimated just how many of us there are. We need to expand them before we completely run out of room. If we do not, something bad may happen."

 EMB_CS01:"Seeking Out the Traitors"
 EMB_CS01_desc:"Fellow members of the council, as we all know just days ago members of the commune stormed the halls of our capital. We need work on stopping this from happening again. The Tunnel’s core offers up talks to form special ideas to deal with them."
 EMB_CS02A:"A Lamp On Every Corner"
 EMB_CS02A_desc:"The lower members of the council put forth the motion to improve the lighting of Ember. They have fears that the traitors that remain move in the darkness. Hiding away like the vermin they are. A motion is brought forward to increase the lighting for the mitila in the city streets. Raise more light posts and give the mitila mining helmets with lamps!"
 EMB_CS02B:"Power of Crystals"
 EMB_CS02B_desc:"Members of the council, loyal drones in the engineering and alchemical unions have come to us with designs for special weapons. Weapons that could burn through 20 creatures in a single shot. They believe that once these weapons are completed it will send terror into the traitors. We should pursue any advantage our loyal drones can give us over those who would seek to destroy what we have made!"
 EMB_CS03A:"The Foundations of a Proper Military"
 EMB_CS03A_desc:"The militias simply do not have the proper training to deal with traitors lurking around the streets of our commune. We have old texts from our old homes. We should look to them for ideas and use them to teach our brave loyal drones!"
 EMB_CS03B:"More to the Militias"
 EMB_CS03B_desc:"The militias need to be expanded so that we can cover more areas inside of the communes. Fellow council members we have no option but to start recruiting more drones for the defence of the capital. Expand the food rations of the militias so that they get more food than most other jobs in the commune. Yes our drones will go hungry, but more will willingly join the ranks!"
 EMB_CS03C:"A Ear in the Underway"
 EMB_CS03C_desc:"Council members, the highest ranking among us, have brought forth the ideas of forming special groups to be our eyes and ears in the Underway.

 EMB_CS04:"Fears of Another Strike"

 EMB_CS05:"The Traitors Show Themselves"
 EMB_CS05_desc:"Strikes have been forming in the streets, brothers and sisters. Our eyes and ears point to members of the Church who are the ones helping these protests organise.

 EMB_CS06_desc:"Members of the council, I can feel something lingering in the air of the Underway. The church is brewing ideas counter to those of the communes. I know that they are! It is time that we gather the militia and begin marching on them. We must round them up, and soon!"
 EMB_CS07:"The End to a Faith"

 EMB_CS09:"Flames to the Texts"
 EMB_CS09_desc:"Brothers, sisters, council members; pires have been built in the centers of all of the communes in Ember. We await your word to begin burning the texts of the traitors.

 EMB_CS10:"Chisel to the Stone"

 EMB_CS11:"Stakes for the Faithful"
 EMB_CS11_desc:"Dear leaders, I bring with me wonderful news. We are ready to judge the traitors of The First Queen. What shall we do with them all? Surely the flock will be treated differently from the preachers. Or do they all deserve punishment?"
 EMB_CS12:"The Absence of Faith"
 EMB_CS12_desc:"With the Children of The First Queen gone, many in the Underway feel as if the tunnels are just a little bit emptier and darker. The ringing of bells, prayer, and merriment used to fill the air of the tunnels. Now all that is left is fear, order, and the sound of militia marching in the air."
 EMB_CS13:"The Wrath of the Council"

 EMB_CS14:"Queen Narratek Speaks Out Against Us"
 EMB_CS14_desc:"Council members, the queen of the hive has spoken out against us. Calling us traitors and for us to resign. Surely she can not be serious, can she? In her blinded ignorance she does not see the dangers those rebels and ideas have on our communes. We should tame her speech before she does something we will all regret!"
 EMB_CS15:"What a Waste of Life"
 EMB_CS15_desc:"Dear leaders, a member of the council and head alchemist has put forth a proposition that would help… Replace… The loss of those who betrayed us. He has the resources needed, however he needs... New spaces dug out in the depths of the Underway and a… volunteer... Brothers and sisters remember what we are voting for."
 EMB_CS16:"The Rule of Fear"
 EMB_CS16_desc:"Members of the council, many of our drones appear to be afraid of us now. Now why would that be? Are they afraid that we will find out they hold traitorous thoughts as well? Members of the militia council push forward motions to begin going door to door and searching for the material of traitors!"
 EMB_CS17:"Introducing a Police Force"
 EMB_CS17_desc:"Not all of the drones on our streets can be trusted council members. We should vote on a motion to raise a policing force. We wished that this day would not have come. However it is no longer an option. It is our duty to bring about a group to protect us!"
 EMB_CS18:"Increasing the Policing"
 EMB_CS18_desc:"Fellow council members, it must be brought to our attention that we simply do not have enough drones in our militias to patrol our streets. A motion must be raised to introduce a conscription. Every drone must serve the communes in some way!"
 EMB_CS19:"None Can Be Trusted"
 EMB_CS19_desc:"We can not trust those around us, brothers and sisters. All those around us would wish for the traitors to ruin our communities and bring us to a end!"

 EMB_CS21:"The Beginning of Our Raids"
 EMB_CS21_desc:"A leader of one of our militias has sent a letter to the council proposing an idea for a possible raid. He suggests that we could conduct a raid on the nation to our south. It will help finally ease the food issues our commune faces. However, war may break out as a result. If it does and we win, it just means more arable land for our farmers."
 EMB_CS22:"Our Neighbors Had the Answer"
 EMB_CS22_desc:"It would appear that the raids we could do could hold much more profit than we anticipated. Our militias need the training that these raids could provide, and all of the food we gather from them proves to help keep our bellies full. Perhaps we could also use them to gather the love we have been lacking for so long…"
 EMB_CS23:"The Underway Will Never Fall!"

 EMB_D01A:"Freinds in the Mountain"
 EMB_D01A_desc:"There are stories that thestras in the mountains to the north are not to be trusted by many, just like us. Perhaps we can find a friendship in that? We should send diplomats and gifts to them. We can learn much and protect one another in these trying times."
 EMB_D01B:"What Can We Offer for Trade"
 EMB_D01B_desc:"We need to start exporting and trading with our neighbors. It would bring in much needed food and maybe other resources. But, we remember the stories and tales about how most ponies treat our kind. We can not expect much. However, it is worth a try."
 EMB_D02:"Setting Sail"
 EMB_D02_desc:"Trading with other nations should continue to be something that we pursue. However our tunnels only reach so far and the jungles can not be traversed so easily. Perhaps we should take an idea from a few of the commune fishers and build proper trading vessels?"
 EMB_D03:"Freinds of Fire"
 EMB_D03_desc:"There are tales of a land out at sea that is filled with scaly beasts. Dragons, a whole land of dragons. Perhaps they could make good trading partners. After all they will surely have resources that we could only dream of. Those dragons may also prove to be more than just trading partners in the feature."

 EMB_LD02:"The Moon and Earth"

 EMB_LD03:"Moon, Earth, and Fire"
 EMB_LD03_desc:"Those scaly things across the sea have been fairly good trading partners. However we have come to find out that they appear to be rejects like us. No one seems to trust them because of their greed. Perhaps if we indulge their greed a little and gain a friend?"

EMB_L00:"A Fortress in the Making"

 EMB_L01A:"Training With Nature"
 EMB_L01A_desc:"We have not lived in these hash jungles for long but we have learned the ways of surviving in these lands. Perhaps we could use that to our advantage. After all, no one can fight better in the jungle than those who work with nature."
 EMB_L01B:"No Stone Not Put to Use"
 EMB_L01B_desc:"We still have plenty of stone laying about after the construction of the first fortress above Ember. Perhaps we can use them to shore up defences there and build the other old villages into fortresses as well."
 EMB_L01C:"Proper Training and Equipment"
 EMB_L01C_desc:"Our militias need proper training and proper weapons. A few soldiers did come to this new land with us so they could offer some training, and some engineers may have some ideas for weapons for our soldiers."
 EMB_L02A:"Timber Wolf Riders"
 EMB_L02A_desc:"It has come to the attention of militia leaders that we need a group of soldiers who can strike back fast and hard against any sort of raiding parties from the jungle to our west. If we can not stop them soon we may have to do something drastic. Hopefully it does not come to that."
 EMB_L02B:"A End to the Raids"
 EMB_L02B_desc:"We need to bring these raids to an end before more of our communes get hurt. However we fully admit that we are not ready for a full scale war against those barbarians. Perhaps we could slowly push them back over time. Perhaps through something such as border wars? Maybe if we push them back far enough we could strike them down for good!"
 EMB_L03:"To Control Our Coast"
 EMB_L03_desc:"We may have the jungles and our militias protecting us on the land. However, what do we have protecting our rivers and coast line…? We should move forward with ideas to have at least a few small ships for coastal defences."
 EMB_L04:"Converting Our Largest Fishing Vessels"
 EMB_L04_desc:"We just got amazing news! Some of the fishing crews from the coast are gifting their boats for the defence of their homeland. It does not sound like much, but they are ships made of steel. With a few conversions and tinkering we could turn them into vessels ready to do battle!"
 EMB_L05:"More Docks For Our Growing Navy"
 EMB_L05_desc:"We have pushed the raiders back far and have gained new territory in the process. Some of that land looks like it could be used for new dock yards for trading and our navy."
 EMB_L06:"Birds of Prey"
 EMB_L06_desc:"It has been brought to our attention that we may need something to fight winged things in the air. Even though we live in the Underway, our fortresses and cost line may need something to help defend them. Perhaps as simple as a large cannon could do the trick?"
 EMB_L07:"A Discovery That Could Change Everything"
 EMB_L07_desc:"One of our fishing vessels found the wreck of a massive ship just off the coast! We do not know how long it has been down there but it looks like we may be able to get it functioning again with time."
