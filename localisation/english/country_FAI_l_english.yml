FAI_S00: "What We Must Do to Survive"
 FAI_S00_desc: "In this modern world we find ourselves in, one must do what they have to to survive; even if it is a sin in the eyes of the sisters. But the Sisters will forgive us in the end my followers. They will understand that we must regrettably do what we must to survive."
 FAI_S00_effect_tooltip: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! will be able to conduct §Oraids§! on it's neighbors and benefit from the §Gloot§! thereof."
 FAI_S01A: "Firing Up Old Factories"
  FAI_S01A_desc: "Look out upon the shells of industry that lay empty before us brothers. Do you not think that they should be brought back to life to serve a greater purpose?! Grab your tools and make haste. There is work to be done, and your idle hooves are crying in desperation to serve the Sisters!"
 FAI_S01B: "The Guns of the Congregation"
  FAI_S01B_desc: "We are blessed, blessed I say! For we have ponies who have the knowledge to craft weapons and firearms! Brothers and sisters, lend them your tools and your hooves, for we must build them a factory. That way they may use their trade to bless us all with divine protection!"
 FAI_S02A: "Radios in Every Home and On Every Street Corner"
  FAI_S02A_desc: "There are creatures out there who wander our streets who have yet to hear the good word! We spread the will of the sisters and our message to the masses, and the best way to do such a thing is through the radio. We must craft radios that even the lowliest of creatures can afford so that they can also hear the good word!"
 FAI_S02B: "Homegrown Innovations"
  FAI_S02B_desc: "Some of the brothers working within the arms factory believe that they can make us a new weapon that can keep the sinners at bay if they march upon us. I will see to it that they get the time and resources they need to innovate."
 FAI_S03A: "Boosting the Signal"
  FAI_S03A_desc: "Brothers and sisters, the towers that carry our sermons across the air waves have the chance to reach further than we could have ever dreamed. All must have a chance to hear them. Even if our teachings go through one ear and out the other, all must have a chance to hear it. Boost the signal and the words of the Sister fill the ears of all!"
  FAI_radio_preacher: "Incessant Radio Preacher"
 FAI_S03B: "They'll Come Loud and They'll Come Fast"
  FAI_S03B_desc: "When those sinners from the outside come to strike us down, they will have bombs and they will have tanks, my brothers. But we must not falter. The sisters will protect us and help us keep the sinners from getting past the gate!"
  FAI_vigilance_at_home: "Vigilance at Home"
 FAI_S03C: "Keep A Rifle By Your Side"
  FAI_S03C_desc: "Oh my dear brothers and sisters, every creature who calls our blessed lands home should own a weapon. Whether it be old and rusted or shiny and new. We must all keep a rifle by our side if those foolish heathens come bashing down our gate!"
  FAI_rifle_by_side: "Keep A Rifle By Your Side"
  FAI_vigilant_flock: "A Vigilant Flock"
 FAI_S04A: "The Sharing of Poppy's Knowledge"
  FAI_S04A_desc: "Though I would prefer to not look back or dwell upon those days I served in the Equestrian army, things I learned while in it could very well help us. If it means the protection of my flock and our survival, then maybe it is worth reliving those dark days so that those around me may learn."
 FAI_S04B: "To Let the Faithful Be Closer to the Sisters"
  FAI_S04B_desc: "There are members of our congregation who have come forth with an idea. They believe that they can turn some of the old crop dusters hiding away in our barns into mighty tools to defend our families. Pass them your tools and let them build my children!"
 FAI_S05: "The Sisters' Most Devoted Servants"
  FAI_S05_desc: "There are those within our congregation with special blessings and gifts who believe that they are being called to a higher purpose. They showed up to the steps of my house of worship in bits and pieces of armor. They deemed themselves as the new royal guard to the Sisters and the faith. Believing themselves to be some of the most devoted to the faith. I will not deny them the duty that they believe that they were blessed with. In fact I wish more of the congregation would come forward to join their ranks."
  FAI_S05_effect_tooltip: "§Y[FAI.GetName]§! will receive a §YRoyal Guard§! division template composted of 4 §7infantry brigades§!, a §Gmilitary police company§!, and §Ga recon company§!."
 FAI_S06A: "The Sinners to Our South"
  FAI_S06A_desc: "The heathens across the river have lost their way. They are beyond being taught the good word anymore by my brothers and sisters. It pains me to say this, but they must be taught a lesson.  Spread the word and rally our congregation. The time has come to bring an end to their sins!"
 FAI_S06B: "The Heathens to the East"
  FAI_S06B_desc: "Floating high in their city of clouds are ponies who think of themselves as servants of the sisters. They fly overhead in their war planes, spreading the same death and chaos I witnessed before the great division! Brothers and sisters we must bring a stop to their madness before it destroys us all! Soon we will march upon their lands, not as conquerors, but as savors and messengers of the good word!"
 FAI_S07A: "A New Use for the Tools of Sinners"
  FAI_S07A_desc: "Those sinners parading around, playing army, had their hooves on some pretty invaluable weapons. Weapons that now we can use and tools to protect ourselves and the holy word of the Sisters. What divine intervention that the Sister would send us against an enemy who would have the tools we need to keep serving them."
  FAI_S07A_effect_tooltip: "\n§Y[FAI.GetName]§! will receive §Y[TFL.GetAdjective]§! early tank equipment and form a division that will marshal in Orshab.\n\nThe Legionary Company composted of...\n3 §5light tank brigades§! and 2 §7infantry brigades§!."
 FAI_S07B: "The Hedonistic Gift"
  FAI_S07B_desc: "Those foolish heathens who called Cloudsdale home left us many things to use in our fight to preserve our faith. What kind of followers would we be if we did not use these gifts bestowed upon us to protect the faithful and our fellow believers."
 FAI_S08: "To Deal with the Heathens and Sinners"
  FAI_S08_desc: "Let it be known that we have tried to make them see the error of their ways. We have tried so hard and in every way that we can. However, some creatures just can not seem to understand and believe in the words of the sisters and our congregation. Brothers and Sisters, try one final time to help them see the light. If they refuse to follow the true path and have faith in the sisters, then they should be sent to Tartarus. They will be in good company there with the rest of the monsters that call that hellish place home."
 FAI_S09: "The One True Home for the Faithful"
  FAI_S09_desc: "We have endured so much to get here, my brothers and sisters. But look at us now. No longer are we the poor, the forgotten, or struggling creatures we were. Our hunger to serve and preserve the will of the Sisters has pushed us this far. We are now mighty. Our congregation grows ever bigger by the day. We are a sanctuary for the faithful and the lost. We are the light in this dark world. And now we must do our best to keep this Sanctuary safe from the sinners outside.  Raise your weapons, raise our flag, and join me in prayer, for we need the strength to prepare us for whatever may come next."
 FAI_S10: "Heaven's Gates"
  FAI_S10_desc: "Brothers and Sisters, though we have dealt with those who would wish to destroy us and our way of life for now, that does not mean more will come. We must take the time that we have and the lessons we have learned to prepare. Fortify the borders with the false profits and harbingers of war. Let them try and pass the gates we construct. When the time comes for them to attack us, they will not pass them!"
