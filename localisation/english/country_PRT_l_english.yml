    PRT_SSF0400_desc: "This bird brain has a gleam in his eye, me lads. He was born a pirate and shall die as one. His silver tongue could charm an emperor out of his land, and his luck at sea has seen his ships sail longer and further than any other."

    PRT_M0200_desc: "We are but businessmen on the high seas wherein our usual methods involve legitimate persuasion and legal "sidelining". That said very few among us are hardy enough for conducting our operations where land meets the sea. We need to fix that so we can go ashore more often."

   PRT_I0000: "Improving the Homeport Just A Wee Bit"
    PRT_I0000_desc: "You call this collection of planks a port? Ayeya wee laddy you've a cruel sense a humor. We be needin' to turn this into a right proper place we can at least stash our booty. Ya hear me boyos? Get to it lads!"
   PRT_I0100: "Salvaging Projects"
    PRT_I0100_desc: "So yer telling me we've not got the steel to repair the boats? Ach! We've got to find something to repair the hull or we're goin' belly up into the ocean blue. Gather the scrap, tupeprware, cookware, sheets of metal, anything. Put up a fire or whatnot and melt it. We'll need it."
   PRT_I0200: "A Bigger Cut for the Lads"
    PRT_I0200_desc: "So the lads tell me they've been thinking about getting a bigger cut. Were it not for the need i'd giv'em their "cut". For now though we'll give them a bigger share of the loot. It can't hurt can it?"
    PRT_cut_bonuses: "Larger Crew Cuts"
     PRT_cut_bonuses_desc: "We told the lads that they'd be getting a bigger cut. They mistook this for putting them in the freezing cold south waters and gotten quipped haircuts. They've since learned it's more of the booty for them. There have since been more recorded slappings back at port."
   PRT_I0201: "Bonuses Paid in Rum"
    PRT_I0201_desc: "So the lads tell me they've been thinking about getting a bigger cut. Were it not for the need i'd giv'em their "cut". For now though we'll give them a rum as a bonus. Surely that can't go wrong, right?"
    PRT_rum_bonuses: "Rum Bonuses"
     PRT_rum_bonuses_desc: "When we told the crew they'd be getting paid in rum, the quartermaster was flabbergasted when it actually worked. Never underestimate what a pirate will do for rum."
   PRT_I0300: "A Use for Those in Da Briggs"
    PRT_I0300_desc: "I tell ya those land puckers in the brig are wastin' away with rations and rum. It's time we put'em to good use making good of themselves. Tis not good to have a ship sink cause of a full brig and no appendages aye?"
    PRT_brigg_labor: "Brigged Labor"
     PRT_brigg_labor_desc: "No no no! We are not replacing your jobs with bricks, though some of our sailors may very well be dumb as bricks. We're putting the accused to work doing things you lily livered lads won't do. Now which one of you accused landlubbers wants to be the first creature to fly?"
   PRT_I0301: "I Came for Ye Booty! Tharb' Treasure Yaknow."
    PRT_I0301_desc: "Arr we all know why we signed up for this accursed venture. For the booty! The treasure! Maybe cause some o' us were at swordpoint, but that's neither here or now. Surely we can find a better way to loot our marks and take away a better haul ayy?"
   PRT_I0400: "Trade Free of Tax or Scrutiny"
    PRT_I0400_desc: "Thar be two things the land lubbers are wary of. Death and Taxes. Sure we deal with the one, but not the other. Maybe we can get some o' the landlubbers to think our way and see the benefits of workin' with us "scum of the sea". It sure beats the alternative."
    PRT_trade_haven: "Trade Haven"
     PRT_trade_haven_desc: "They say the biggest hubs o' money protect the wealth o' those buyin' in. I suppose that's what we have here. The griffon's share of all the world's money and goods pass through our shores and it's bound to make us rich."
   PRT_I0401: "The Cubuck Rum Run"
    PRT_I0401_desc: "Thar be one thing a pirate loves more than freedom and booty and that be rum. Course the good stuff be hidden away in a box all locked up with locks. What's that you thought we we're talkin about that frigid hellhole inland? What do we look like? Bandits? We're talking the good stuff in the Southern Seas. So what'r we waitin' for?"
    PRT_cubuck_rum: "Cubuckian Rum"
     PRT_cubuck_rum_desc: "Nothing like a good Cubuckian Rum to drink and trade. We're we law abidin' folk, we'd be using this as money. Instead we sell the excess for a good profit."
   PRT_I0402: "More Legitimate Business Ventures"
    PRT_I0402_desc: "Thar be one thing that we need if we want to make all the money in the world. Surely the crews that finish a voyage need somewhere to lie low and make a livin'. Why not set'em up with a nice little business, one we can look to for services as we please? So long as we do right by our kin we can stand to make a decent boon."
   PRT_I0500: "We Control the Trade in the Southern Seas!"
    PRT_I0500_desc: "Avast we will control the southern seas and all the trade that flows through them from all around the world. We stand to make a killin' so long as we be controllin' the high seas. Let's make it official aye?"
    PRT_south_seas_trade: "Control of the South Seas Trade"
     PRT_south_seas_trade_desc: "Avast we control the southern seas and all the trade that flows through them from all around the world. We stand to make a killin' so long as we be controllin' the high seas."
