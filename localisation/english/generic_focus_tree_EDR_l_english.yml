   EDR_P0000: "The Death of an Era"
    EDR_P0000_desc: "Equestria was once the beacon of Harmony, Peace, and Friendship. And yet for all it stands for the dream was shattered with a titanic war, the disappearances of the Royal Sisters, and the continuing cycle of the stars. It is in this climate that chaos erupted rending the nation apart. We must now decide for ourselves a course of action in order to ensure our survival; whether by harmony or any other means."
   EDR_P0100: "Questioning the Past"
    EDR_P0100_desc: "It is a curious thing to find that the Sun and Moon continue to rise without the royal sisters. While there is surely an explanation, what quickly becomes obvious is the lie we have been told for generations; or perhaps what we told ourselves. This brings into question the entirety of the Equestrian Dream. Perhaps it is time to go off the trodden path and explore the truth we hold dear."
    EDR_alicorn_doubt: "Anti-Alicorn Sentiment"
     EDR_alicorn_doubt_desc: ""
   EDR_P0101: "Look Towards Our Roots"
    EDR_P0101_desc: "Harmony as we knew it has proven itself to have shortfalls that cannot be overcome. A new approach is needed to guide us. For centuries our customs and traditions have been preserved regardless of our wider Equestrian identity. Perhaps it is time to look to the past and rediscover our roots. In such a way we may find a new path laid before us; one that will guide us to a better tomorrow."
    EDR_sovereignty: "Restoration of Sovereignty"
     EDR_sovereignty_desc: ""
   EDR_P0102: "Returning to Tradition"
    EDR_P0102_desc: "While Harmony as we knew it has failed in the face of the challenges of our time, we may yet salvage it's key principles going forward. Our core values need not be thrown away in the face of despair, but be reformed to suit the then and now. We must endure and keep hope that the future will be brighter, even if we must adapt to see it through. The chaos of the present will not dampen our spirits."
    EDR_hope: "Hopes for the Future"
   EDR_P0200: "To Kill an Idea"
    EDR_P0200_desc: "As with all things, the old must give way to the new in order to progress. Long gone are the days of Equestria and it's version of Harmony and Friendship. Instead we must clear the slate, even if it leads to upheaval. We must sacrifice that which we once held dear in order to explore that which may bring a brighter future. By whatever means this may be done, one cannot be certain, but it is inevitable."
   EDR_P0201: "To Renew the Present"
    EDR_P0201_desc: "In the past we suffered our mistakes and learned from them. With the olden ways of our people slowly being rediscovered and coming to fruition we may at last be able to restore some semblance of peace. To achieve the long term prosperity and security we must first set ourselves on the right track. To achieve this we must apply the lessons we have learned in full measure, regardless of the short term."
   EDR_P0202: "To Hope for the Future"
    EDR_P0202_desc: "Once upon a time we were an independent nation hampered by conflict and squabbling. When the royal sisters brought us under the Equestrian banner we were shown the benefits of friendship, a wider cooperation, and what they could bring. While such principles may no longer be as simple to maintain we must strive for a better tomorrow. We must not give up hope no matter what befalls us."
   EDR_P0300: "For the Greater Good"
    EDR_P0300_desc: "The current government has long denied the ponies it governs and ignored the need for change. In the name of survival it is time to uplift the greater whole of the land. Whether this mean a peaceful revolution or the shedding of blood, we will reform the government for the benefit of all. The means will justify the ends. For the greater good!"
   EDR_P0301: "Peace Through Power"
    EDR_P0301_desc: "Long has our government sat idly while the world around us changes, even as those without look to swallow us whole. We have not come this far just to give up now. Whether our leaders see merit or not in this approach, we must take action to ensure our future. After all peace is only guaranteed by the force we wield. Peace through power!"
   EDR_P0302: "Home and Hearth"
    EDR_P0302_desc: "For too long we have relied on Canterlot to handle our foreign policy. It is high time our government stood up to the challenge and took up the authority it is due. If this means reigning in internal threats to our sovereignty, so be it. We must do this to protect that which we cherish most. For home and hearth!"
   EDR_P0303: "An Enduring Dream"
    EDR_P0303_desc: "For all we have endured in the past few years, for all that our neighbors and friends have suffered, the dream still lives on. We must reinvigorate our governing body to remind them of their oaths not to the crown or it's absent regency, but the idea of Equestria as a whole. We must preserve the dream not yet lost. The Dream Endures!"
   EDR_P0400: "Land Reform and Redistribution"
    EDR_P0400_desc: "We have succeeded in instituting a government that serves the collective interests of our people. It is time we acted on our promises to bring prosperity to them. The chaos of the divide has seen much land abandoned, disputed, or claimed by land barons. Addressing these issues with various methods of collective land ownership may benefit us in the short and long term, assuming all goes well."
   EDR_P0401: "Security Through Force"
    EDR_P0401_desc: "To ensure peace, we must be prepared for conflict. There will come a time when our neighbors will march on our doorstep whether with words or guns. To preserve our existence in a war torn Eqeustria we must be able to secure our existence. Whether this means striking first or simply preparing for the war that will come, we will be ready to take such action when the time comes."
   EDR_P0402: "The Rock of Foundation"
    EDR_P0402_desc: "Back in times immemorial before the Equestrian Diarchy held domain over Equestria, the great nations of the past struggled for dominion over the continent. One of the greatest tools for control over the land were fortifications. During the period of Celestia's reign many fell out of service. It may be time to restore these old structures whilst also constructing new ones in order to defend ourselves from our foes."
   EDR_P0403: "Uncovering the Spark"
    EDR_P0403_desc: "When Equestria fell, there were a great many things buried or forgotten by those who upheld it in an effort to deny the despots of tomorrow their benefits. While it may be a difficult prospect to recover these articles of knowledge, obtaining them will be a massive boon to our restoration efforts. If a united Equestria were capable of so much, surely there are secrets it held that will be useuful to us."
   EDR_P0500: "Societal Revival"
    EDR_P0500_desc: "Now that the land has been redistributed, we should look into strengthening ourselves lest our neighbors begin to eye our homes with envy. To such an end we should attempt to revive our local communities in preparation of such an inevitability. Our finest minds have devised a five year plan to not only achieve this, but prepare for the dark times ahead should we survive to see them."
   EDR_P0501: "The Guns of Sovereignty"
    EDR_P0501_desc: "In order to preserve our sovereignty in this new paradigm of Equestrian survival, we must have the arms to protect it. To this end we must encourage the establishment of military factories and foster the spirit to run them. With them we can build weapons of war beyond simple infantry equipment. It's as a cantankerous griffon once said - \n"Without artillery a nation is a theory, with them a nation is a fact"."
   EDR_P0502: "Every Hearth a Hoof"
    EDR_P0502_desc: "One thing our olden ancestors had that we are currently lacking is a population that could reasonably defend itself in times of strife. The peace that dominated the later years of the Diarchy has more or less nullified that practice for many ponies. In order to defend ourselves from those who would seek to attack us, we must reforge those olden traditions so that we may defend our homes in times of great danger."
   EDR_P0503: "Lessons of Cooperation"
    EDR_P0503_desc: "If there is anything that made Equestria the nation it was in the past, it was the unity and friendship that brought everypony together to achieve great things. This highly cohesive cooperation among not only citizens, but allies is what heralded prosperity for generations. Such values should not only be valued, but cherished. We should mirror our policies to reflect and strengthen such a message."
   EDR_P0600: "Proactive Initiatives"
    EDR_P0600_desc: "Even now as we establish ourselves, our enemies are plotting to destroy us in the name of any number of causes. To ensure we never again experience the chaos of the great divide, we must be proactive. Our influence must extend to our neighbors and those without - for what concerns them may inevitably come after us. The people must be made aware of this and be encouraged to act if need be."
   EDR_P0601: "A Call to Arms"
    EDR_P0601_desc: "In order to protect our fragile position from the great powers of Equestria that would seek to engulf us in their woes we will need to arm every able hoof that we can. To this call to preserve what we have created and hold dear, many will come; if not willingly then by any means necessary. Afterall a gun and the willingness to remain an independent power is nothing without those who would protect it."
   EDR_P0602: "For Home and Country"
    EDR_P0602_desc: "In the early years of Equestria's formation and some time even before that a citizen would owe their allegeiance and keep their hearts to their home province or prior regional identity. One such famous saying that sums up this feeling is the Albioneese "For King and Country". Such a sentiment cannot be understated. We should foster such a spirit in our countrymen that they may cherish that what we all hold dear."
   EDR_P0603: "Lost, Not Forgotten"
    EDR_P0603_desc: "Many things we used to take for granted in the old Equestria have long since fallen to the wayside or been destroyed by the Great Divide. While such ideals and meanings may be lost forever to the scars that may never heal, we will not forget what they taught us. We must learn from our mistakes and strive forward despite it all. Let the Equestrian dream be memorialized; it's mistakes and sacrifices never forgotten."
   EDR_P0700: "A Bulwark in the Dark"
    EDR_P0700_desc: "Regardless of how we got to this point we have no doubt established our place in this dark and cruel world we live in. Every citizen must be made aware that our tenuous position in the shattered country is not guaranteed and must be preserved by any means necessary lest we fall to the machinations of our enemies or collapse again into despair. We are a bulwark against the darkness and must withstand at all costs."
   EDR_P0701: "A Stand Against Chaos"
    EDR_P0701_desc: "For too long have we endured the lawlessness of the Great Divide. It is up to creatures such as us to weather and calm the storm through our strengths combined. We all seek purpose in our lives and ours seems to be cut out for us. It is our duty to seek out those who share our concerns and to form together for our common goal against those who would wreak chaos with reckless abandon. In this we are united."

Those industrialists who haven't fled for New Mareland have thrown their lot in with the houses or what remains of the safer cities of Eques. With that we are left with a war-torn economy racked by successive conflicts and raids. It's a miracle we have anything left. In order to properly revive our workforce, we will need to acquire industrial tools."
