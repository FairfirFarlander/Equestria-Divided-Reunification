   EDR_P0000: "The Death of an Era"
    EDR_P0000_desc: "Equestria was once the beacon of Harmony, Peace, and Friendship. And yet for all it stands for the dream was shattered with a titanic war, the disappearances of the Royal Sisters, and the continuing cycle of the stars. It is in this climate that chaos erupted rending the nation apart. We must now decide for ourselves a course of action in order to ensure our survival; whether by harmony or any other means."
   EDR_P0100: "Questioning the Past"
    EDR_P0100_desc: "It is a curious thing to find that the Sun and Moon continue to rise without the royal sisters. While there is surely an explanation, what quickly becomes obvious is the lie we have been told for generations; or perhaps what we told ourselves. This brings into question the entirety of the Equestrian Dream. Perhaps it is time to go off the trodden path and explore the truth we hold dear."
    EDR_alicorn_doubt: "Anti-Alicorn Sentiment"
     EDR_alicorn_doubt_desc: ""
   EDR_P0101: "Look Towards Our Roots"
    EDR_P0101_desc: "Harmony as we knew it has proven itself to have shortfalls that cannot be overcome. A new approach is needed to guide us. For centuries our customs and traditions have been preserved regardless of our wider Equestrian identity. Perhaps it is time to look to the past and rediscover our roots. In such a way we may find a new path laid before us; one that will guide us to a better tomorrow."
    EDR_sovereignty: "Restoration of Sovereignty"
     EDR_sovereignty_desc: ""
   EDR_P0102: "Returning to Tradition"
    EDR_P0102_desc: "While Harmony as we knew it has failed in the face of the challenges of our time, we may yet salvage it's key principles going forward. Our core values need not be thrown away in the face of despair, but be reformed to suit the then and now. We must endure and keep hope that the future will be brighter, even if we must adapt to see it through. The chaos of the present will not dampen our spirits."
    EDR_hope: "Hopes for the Future"
   EDR_P0200: "To Kill an Idea"
    EDR_P0200_desc: "As with all things, the old must give way to the new in order to progress. Long gone are the days of Equestria and it's version of Harmony and Friendship. Instead we must clear the slate, even if it leads to upheaval. We must sacrifice that which we once held dear in order to explore that which may bring a brighter future. By whatever means this may be done, one cannot be certain, but it is inevitable."
   EDR_P0201: "To Renew the Present"
    EDR_P0201_desc: "In the past we suffered our mistakes and learned from them. With the olden ways of our people slowly being rediscovered and coming to fruition we may at last be able to restore some semblance of peace. To achieve the long term prosperity and security we must first set ourselves on the right track. To achieve this we must apply the lessons we have learned in full measure, regardless of the short term."
   EDR_P0202: "To Hope for the Future"
    EDR_P0202_desc: "Once upon a time we were an independent nation hampered by conflict and squabbling. When the royal sisters brought us under the Equestrian banner we were shown the benefits of friendship, a wider cooperation, and what they could bring. While such principles may no longer be as simple to maintain we must strive for a better tomorrow. We must not give up hope no matter what befalls us."
   EDR_P0300: "For the Greater Good"
    EDR_P0300_desc: "The current government has long denied the ponies it governs and ignored the need for change. In the name of survival it is time to uplift the greater whole of the land. Whether this mean a peaceful revolution or the shedding of blood, we will reform the government for the benefit of all. The means will justify the ends. For the greater good!"
   EDR_P0301: "Peace Through Power"
    EDR_P0301_desc: "Long has our government sat idly while the world around us changes, even as those without look to swallow us whole. We have not come this far just to give up now. Whether our leaders see merit or not in this approach, we must take action to ensure our future. After all peace is only guaranteed by the force we wield. Peace through power!"
   EDR_P0302: "Home and Hearth"
    EDR_P0302_desc: "For too long we have relied on Canterlot to handle our foreign policy. It is high time our government stood up to the challenge and took up the authority it is due. If this means reigning in internal threats to our sovereignty, so be it. We must do this to protect that which we cheerish most. For home and hearth!"
   EDR_P0303: "An Enduring Dream"
    EDR_P0303_desc: "For all we have endured in the past few years, for all that our neighbors and friends have suffered, the dream still lives on. We must reinvigorate our governing body to remind them of their oaths not to the crown or it's absent regency, but the idea of Equestria as a whole. We must preserve the dream not yet lost. The Dream Endures!"
   EDR_P0400: "Land Reform and Redistribution"
    EDR_P0400_desc: "We have succeeded in instituting a government that serves the collective interests of our people. It is time we acted on our promises to bring prosperity to them. The chaos of the divide has seen much land abandoned, disputed, or claimed by land barons. Addressing these issues with various methods of collective land ownership may benefit us in the short and long term, assuming all goes well."
   EDR_P0401: "Security Through Force"
    EDR_P0401_desc: "To ensure peace, we must be prepared for conflict. There will come a time when our neighbors will march on our doorstep whether with words or guns. To preserve our existence in a war torn Eqeustria we must be able to secure our existence. Whether this means striking first or simply preparing for the war that will come, we will be ready to take such action when the time comes."

To such an end we should attempt to revive our local communities in preparation of such an inevitability. Our finest minds have devised a five year plan to not only achieve this, but prepare for the dark times ahead should we survive to see them."

To ensure we never again experience the chaos of the great divide, we must be proactive. Our influence must extend to our neighbors and those without - for what concerns them may inevitably come after us. The people must be made aware of this and be encouraged to act if need be."
