   EAW_WS_THA: "The Lunar Holds"
    EAW_WS_THA_desc: "The story of Ayacachtli is a sorrow filled tale as of late. The recent tragedies of this nation looms over it like a sickly darkness. A sickly "King of The Mountain" rules over these mountains named Argent End, a stallion whose odd disease causes him to almost rot away as he ages. Many theories have flouted about how the young pony got such an illness. Because of this, it is unknown just how long Argent has left to live. Despite this affliction, he does his best to rule over those around him.\n\nAs Equestria slipped into Chaos and began to break apart, the few thestral hold outs left in the land began to fall one by one. Refugees began fleeing their homes and coming to Ayacachtli in the hopes of finding safety. Few would actually make it to the mountains. Those who did brought with them horrifying tales of the raids and battles that came to them. Soon enough the ponies of Ayacachtli believed that they were the final hold out of thestral kind and culture. With these thoughts and stories, many came to wonder if it was still worth fighting.\n\nDespite all of this, the young ruler was determined to lead his hold through the darkness. He gathered up everyone willing to fight and led them into battles as his health worsened. Leading what small armies he could muster to secure his realm. What they lacked in size, they made up for in skill and passion. The thestral armies defended their mountains from the chaos that surrounded them valiantly. Eventually the outsiders stopped bringing war to their mountains. Ayacachtli would finally know a peace after years of defencive war, however it is a tense peace that can come to a swift end at any moment.\n\nBecause of this, Argent End has set his eyes down a path he thinks will lead his kind to better days. One that involves a focus of defence and building what bridges he can with surrounding nations. Will it really be enough to protect his subjects, and will he be able to live long enough to see those better days come? Only time will tell."

    THA_aend_leader_desc: "$CRDC_art_tiviyl$\n\nOne of the youngest to ever take the throne in Ayacachtli, Argent End may very well also become one it’s shortest reigning rulers. Argent’s body has been slowly rotting and withering away ever since he was a young foal. Fearing his appearance would scare others away, he chooses to hide himself behind a mask and robes. He has grown to fear his mortality not because he is afraid of dying, but because he is afraid he won't be able to bring his nation into better times with the time that he has left. Will he come to accept his fate, or will he choose to find a way to fight his looming doom. Only time will tell."

   THA_S0000: "The Mountain Stands Strong"
    THA_S0000_desc: "The time has come for my armies to return to our homes. At long last we can return to our mountain and be at peace. However, I fear that deep down I know our neighbors will try once again to harm us. I will not yet tell my soldiers my fears. They deserve a chance to rest and see their families. For now let us return and celebrate what victories we can. For I fear that even darker days lay ahead of us."
    THA_ES.000000.t: "The March Back to Ayacachtli"
     THA_ES.000000.d: "With our victory at Fort Golden realized, we have managed to drive back the mad ponies to the holes whence they came. Surely they will not be so eager to attack us again after such a setback. And yet such a victory goes both ways. Many of our number fell in the attack despite having every advantage at our disposal in the dead of the night. The flashes of muzzles and crack of rifled weapons still ring in my ears. Yet despite the bodycount, we have made sure to recover our brethren and set alight what we could not, that their souls may ascend to the moon and not be brandished by the sun.\n\nWe march back home that we might rest from our labors and reunite with our families. Yet the going is rough as the ground beneath begins to moisten and our burden weighs us down. When we at last reach the safety of our mountain home we may find sturdy purchase and familiar winds to guide our wings. The halls of our kin will be filled with much celebration before the full moon rises. This old warrior would only hope that would be the end of it."
     THA_ES.000000.a: "So lies the journey ahead."
    THA_ES.000001.t: "Welcome Home"
     THA_ES.000001.d: "At last we have arrived at the outskirts of the ancient city. There are no walls to bar our entry as we cross the surface and the sizable city that rests here. A wide variety of faces come to witness our march towards the mountain's maw, curious as to our arrival and plight. What they were greeted with was a procession of the king's army in all their glory after the recent campaign. Surely we must be a spectacular sight to behold or perhaps all the grimmer for the burdens we carry.\n\nBy the time we reached the ancient gates to the realm beneath the stone, they were fully open to us; no doubt aware of our arrival. And so we continued our course towards the city proper and the mustering grounds within. By now the residents had perceived our presence, cheering our arrival and welcoming us with open arms. Cries of joy and jubilation would continue to echo through the cavernous abodes below accompanied by the sounds of thousands of flapping wings and stomping hooves.\n\nThe cacophony surely would have been deafening save for the end of our procession giving pause to all who witnessed it's composition. The sight of our fallen brought a standstill to the merriment and gave birth to an aura of sadness. Weeping slowly overtook the city as we went, the news quickly spreading throughout. By the time we had reached the mustering grounds for dismissal, the mood had taken to sorrow and melancholy. Those who were able would leave for their homes and duties to attempt to retrieve and bury their loved ones."
     THA_ES.000001.a: "For now we rest."
    THA_ES.000002.t: "The Great Mourning"
     THA_ES.000002.d: "Throughout the night the thestrals of the Lunar Holds mourned for the fallen whether out of personal relation, to comfort those close to them, or out of respect for those who paid in blood for the holds. Those who had fought in the field tried their best to identify their deceased comrades in arms and deliver the news to their next of kin. The preisthood would try their best to comfort those whom they could yet their efforts would prove difficult in the confusion. Yet throughout it all the mood was unmistakably that of great loss, something that would no doubt echo for years to come."
     THA_ES.000002.a: "Luna wept. Luna wept."
     THA_the_great_mourning: "The Great Mourning"
      THA_the_great_mourning_desc: "Our people grieve for those who have died in the war against [PLF.GetNameDef]. Many have traveled from all across the holds to pay their respects for the fallen. For now we will conduct burial rights to ensure they reach the afterlife."
    THA_ES.000003.t: "A King's Tears"
     THA_ES.000003.d: "When my soldiers and I first returned to the city in the mountain, we were welcomed as heroes. Crowds greeted us with cheers, that is until they saw what came in behind us. Carts filled with those who had given everything in the defense of our home. So many of us had fallen. The cheers quickly turned to tears and morning as my ponies saw cart after cart come in behind us.\n\nSome hours have passed since our arrival. I find myself coming to tears as the tally of bodies keeps climbing. Every ruler must accept that his soldiers will fall in battle. It is inevitable, but to have so many. They tell me the number is now at three thousand. I must summon the priests from the temple and the holds as a whole. I can do little to mend their families pain, but the least we can do it tend to their funerals."

    THA_ES.000004.t: "The Most of Little Time"
     THA_ES.000004.d: "I must use these times of peace to mend and strengthen my kingdom. Even if we have little time to do so, we must make the most of it. I must gather my thoughts and make some kind of plan. Perhaps I should start with meeting with the pillars of our mountain; the military, the temple, and the record keepers. Speaking to them may just help me find the right path."
     THA_ES.000004.a: "Time will tell."
   THA_S0100: "Meeting with the Guard"
    THA_S0100_desc: "I like to think of myself as a competent general, but with all of these recent losses I have begun to question myself. I must go to my old friend Auburn. He has been in the military for longer than I have been alive, and should have a few ideas. Maybe he has a few ways for us to improve our situation."

We can begin rationing the food we can grow, but soon we will have to find a more permanent solution. The ponies of this mountain will not stand for rationing like this forever."

    THA_SN0401_desc: "I know that my mountain is in crisis. And with every day it seems as if this once utopian land becomes more and more hellish. We must begin efforts to shore up our defences and prepare for the darkness that lays ahead. We should start by rebuilding and reinforcing the walls at the city entrance. It will take a while but if anything will help us survive this chaos it will be the walls."

    THA_SN0402_desc: "After years of battle with our neighbors we were able to secure our place here in the south east, and even expand past the origin borders of our city state. But all of this has come at a grave cost to my Kingdom. We do not have an army big enough to cover all of this territory. Perhaps we should arm some of the local populace in the surrounding mountains and pay them a little gold. They will not be the best of fighters, but we are in need of soldiers."
   THA_SN0500: "Expanding The Workshops"

    THA_SN0501_desc: "The enemies of this mountain are many and still wish to see her toppled. We spent so many years trying to defend against those who wish us nothing but harm, and I will not see them succeed if they try again. Auburn believes we could learn a thing or two from his old equestrian tactic books. I will trust him and allow him to spread these with the troops."
   THA_SN0502: "Reinforcing the Macintosh Mountains"
    THA_SN0502_desc: "There is a large town and a few villages of ours out in the mountains to the west. Although the mountains offer great protection, they do not have any protection beyond those rocky defenders. I am sure that we can spare the stone to build a fortress out there, but it will take a little time for it all to get there."
   THA_SN0503: "Sending Out Patrols"
    THA_SN0503_desc: "The mountains that surround us are our protectors.  They can slow or even halt an enemy advance. However we can not rely on them for protection from everything. We must train a group of ponies to patrol the mountains and hold any enemies at bay within them."
