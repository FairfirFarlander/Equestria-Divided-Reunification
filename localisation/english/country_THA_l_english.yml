   EAW_WS_THA: "The Lunar Holds"
    EAW_WS_THA_desc: "The story of Ayacachtli is a sorrow filled tale as of late. The recent tragedies of this nation looms over it like a sickly darkness. A sickly "King of The Mountain" rules over these mountains named Argent End, a stallion whose odd disease causes him to almost rot away as he ages. Many theories have flouted about how the young pony got such an illness. Because of this, it is unknown just how long Argent has left to live. Despite this affliction, he does his best to rule over those around him.\n\nAs Equestria slipped into Chaos and began to break apart, the few thestral hold outs left in the land began to fall one by one. Refugees began fleeing their homes and coming to Ayacachtli in the hopes of finding safety. Few would actually make it to the mountains. Those who did brought with them horrifying tales of the raids and battles that came to them. Soon enough the ponies of Ayacachtli believed that they were the final hold out of thestral kind and culture. With these thoughts and stories, many came to wonder if it was still worth fighting.\n\nDespite all of this, the young ruler was determined to lead his hold through the darkness. He gathered up everyone willing to fight and led them into battles as his health worsened. Leading what small armies he could muster to secure his realm. What they lacked in size, they made up for in skill and passion. The thestral armies defended their mountains from the chaos that surrounded them valiantly. Eventually the outsiders stopped bringing war to their mountains. Ayacachtli would finally know a peace after years of defencive war, however it is a tense peace that can come to a swift end at any moment.\n\nBecause of this, Argent End has set his eyes down a path he thinks will lead his kind to better days. One that involves a focus of defence and building what bridges he can with surrounding nations. Will it really be enough to protect his subjects, and will he be able to live long enough to see those better days come? Only time will tell."

    THA_aend_leader_desc: "$CRDC_art_tiviyl$\n\nOne of the youngest to ever take the throne in Ayacachtli, Argent End may very well also become one it’s shortest reigning rulers. Argent’s body has been slowly rotting and withering away ever since he was a young foal. Fearing his appearance would scare others away, he chooses to hide himself behind a mask and robes. He has grown to fear his mortality not because he is afraid of dying, but because he is afraid he won't be able to bring his nation into better times with the time that he has left. Will he come to accept his fate, or will he choose to find a way to fight his looming doom. Only time will tell."

   THA_S0000: "The Mountain Stands Strong"
    THA_S0000_desc: "The time has come for my armies to return to our homes. At long last we can return to our mountain and be at peace. However, I fear that deep down I know our neighbors will try once again to harm us. I will not yet tell my soldiers my fears. They deserve a chance to rest and see their families. For now let us return and celebrate what victories we can. For I fear that even darker days lay ahead of us."
    THA_ES.000000.t: "The March Back to Ayacachtli"
     THA_ES.000000.d: "With our victory at Fort Golden realized, we have managed to drive back the madponies to the holes whence they came. Surely they will not be so eager to attack us again after such a setback. And yet such a victory goes both ways. Many of our number fell in the attack despite having every advantage at our disposal in the dead of the night. The flashes of muzzles and crack of rifled weaponry still rings in my ears. Yet despite the bodycount, we have made sure to recover our bretheren and set alight what we could not that their souls may acsend to the moon and not be brandished by the sun.\n\nWe march back home that we might rest from our labors and reunite with our families. Yet the going is rough as the ground beneath begins to moisten and our burden weighs us down. When we at last reach the safety of our mountain home we may find sturdy purchase and familiar winds to guide our wings. Only then can we rest easy knowing the safety in the realm of the emaculate moon."

Carts filled with those who had given everything in the defence of our home. So many of us had fallen. The cheers quickly turned to tears and morning as my ponies saw cart after cart come in behind us."

    THA_SD07A_desc: "Our mountain is in a state of chaos. And now everyone in it is looking towards me for what to do. I am not my father, I do not have an answer for seemingly everything. But I have to come up with some kind of plan. With time I should be able to come up with something.”
   THA_SD07B: "Reinforcing The City Walls"
    THA_SD07B_desc: "I know that my mountain is in crisis. And with every day it seems as if this once utopian land becomes more and more hellish. We must begin efforts to shore up our defences and prepare for the darkness that lays ahead. We should start by rebuilding and reinforcing the walls at the city entrance. It will take a while but if anything will help us survive this chaos it will be the walls."
   THA_SD07C: "Expanding The Workshops"
    THA_SD07C_desc: "We must use this peace time wisely. We need to expand the workshops of the city into proper factories. Send building crews out and begin their expansion immediately!"
   THA_SD07D: "Villager Militias"
    THA_SD07D_desc: "After years of battle with our neighbors we were able to secure our place here in the south east, and even expand past the origin borders of our city state. But all of this has come at a grave cost to my Kingdom. We do not have an army big enough to cover all of this territory. Perhaps we should arm some of the local populace in the surrounding mountains and pay them a little gold. They will not be the best of fighters, but we are in need of soldiers."
   THA_SD08A: "Bracing For What May Come Next"
    THA_SD08A_desc: "The enemies of this mountain are many and still wish to see her toppled. We spent so many years trying to defend against those who wish us nothing but harm, and I will not see them succeed if they try again. Auburn believes we could learn a thing or two from his old equestrian tactic books. I will trust him and allow him to spread these with the troops."
   THA_SD08B: "Addressing The Lack Of Food"
    THA_SD08B_desc: "We were already struggling to feed everyone within this city before the fall of Equestria. Now, we truly can not feed everyone here. We can begin rationing the food we can grow, but soon we will have to find a more permanent solution. The ponies of this mountain will not stand for rationing like this forever."
   THA_SD08C: "Telescopes and Binoculars"
    THA_SD08C_desc: "If we could have some kind of more advanced warning of enemy positioning or the ability to see them from afar we may be able to get a small edge over our invaders."
   THA_SD08D: "Sending Out Patrols"
    THA_SD08D_desc: "The mountains that surround us are our protectors.  They can slow or even halt an enemy advance. However we can not rely on them for protection from everything. We must train a group of ponies to patrol the mountains and hold any enemies at bay within them."
