   EDRG_NW1.01.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Yesterday, [HEB.GetAdjective] forces crossed the border into [COT.GetAdjective] territory to finish what they had started last year; the iradication of [COT.GetNameDef]. The shots fired near Fort Sorrow mark the beginning of the Second Confederate Earthborn War. The South has once again been roiled into turmoil that will see it's landscape shorn apart. The rest of the Equestrian world holds it's breath as this may just be a prelude to the storm that is to come."

  EDRG_EW1.01.t: "A Pearn Harbor"
   EDRG_EW1.01.d: "Will complete later."    #The Fruit of the South, a civilian sloop enters the harbor near Fort Mourn and tries to make a apple, cornbread, peanut, and pear delivery in the night. At first they are successful until an Earthborn artillery unit starts firing shots at the unloading ship. The ship leaves without a scratch having only unloaded some cargo (mostly cornbread and peanuts). The garrison is thus left to fish out what crates of pears were chucked off the ship into the water during their escape.
   EDRG_EW1.01.a: "Cold, shaken, but not stirred."
