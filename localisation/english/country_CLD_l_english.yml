   CLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When Equestria fractured during the Great Divide, Cloudsdale weathered the storm under the care of the Wonderbolts. Loyal to a fault the city on the clouds gathered to the Eqeustrian banner all who held the equestrian dream to their hearts. Yet tradgedy would strike when Rainbow Dash, the Element of Loyalty, caused a schism within the city and tore the defenders of Equestria in two. With the departure of a former hero of the Princessdom and many of her followers, the bastion of loyalty fractured and faded into the chaos gripping the nation. Now alone, Cloudsdale hangs by a feather. Amidst the coming turmoil the ponies of Cloudsdale must adapt to the winds of change or be engulfed by the maelstrom."

   CLD_S0000: "The City Council’s Fateful Meeting"
    CLD_S0000_desc: "Members of the city council have gathered together within the ruins of city hall. There are many within the council whose faith in the Wonderbolts has been shaken. There are still those among them who still have faith in their city’s heroes, and want to believe they will save them."
    CLD_ES.000000.t: "The City Council’s Decision"
     CLD_ES.000000.d: "As the final member of the city council entered city hall, they locked the doors locked behind them. Making sure that no pony was able to leave until a solution had been decided upon. Once pleasantries were exchanged, discussion began in earnest. Hours would go by as the council members debated back and forth about what they should do. Tensions were quickly rising as the back and forth went on and on, especially between two members of the council; an old stallion named Lilac and a younger one by the name of Firecracker. Suddenly everything comes to a head as Lilac begins to yell at Firecracker.\n\n"Are you blind to the world we live in now, you fool..? Look outside, our city is in ruins and its citizens are scared. I want to see an end to all of this. Do you not as well? Or do you just wish to see our city continue to suffer because of your inability to see the obvious?!"\n\nThe other council members looked at one another in shock. Quietly murmuring with one another about the old stallion’s words."
     CLD_ES.000000.a: "That is until Firecracker began to speak again..."
     CLD_ES.000001.d: ""I want all of this fighting to come to an end as well, but I am not willing to look towards the ponies who are partly responsible for all of this for some kind of empty salvation. The Wonderbolts have done their best to protect us and will continue to do their best. They are the heroes of Cloudsdale. I know they will save us. You should know that better than any other pony of this council."\n\nFirecracker said this as he stared down Councillor Lilac with narrowing eyes, his eyes slowly falling upon the scuffed up Wonderbolt medal hanging from the stallion’s chest. Lilac would glare back with a similar look of disdain. Their argument only coming to an end by another member of the council begins to voice their own worries and concerns about the situation the city finds itself in.\n\nDebate between the city council members would continue to rage on for hours. Long into the night, and into the early hours of the morning, but one side would have to win out in the end. As the sun finally began to rise, the city council would leave their meeting place, a decision having been made..."
     CLD_ES.000001.a: "The council will support the Wonderbolts."
     CLD_ES.000001.b: "The council will send a message to Stormwing."
