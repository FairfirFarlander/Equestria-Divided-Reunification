   CLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When Equestria fractured during the Great Divide, Cloudsdale weathered the storm under the care of the Wonderbolts. Loyal to a fault the city on the clouds gathered to the Eqeustrian banner all who held the equestrian dream to their hearts. Yet tradgedy would strike when Rainbow Dash, the Element of Loyalty, caused a schism within the city and tore the defenders of Equestria in two. With the departure of a former hero of the Princessdom and many of her followers, the bastion of loyalty fractured and faded into the chaos gripping the nation. Now alone, Cloudsdale hangs by a feather. Amidst the coming turmoil the ponies of Cloudsdale must adapt to the winds of change or be engulfed by the maelstrom."

   EAW_WS_CLD: "The Cradle of §4Pegasai Kind§!"
    EAW_WS_CLD_desc: "The ponies of Cloudsdale were once a part of a coalition of towns and that clung to the ideas of Equestria. But with the coalition falling apart, they have now found themselves alone. This little nation is the holdout of the Wonderbolts who chose not side with Rainbow Dash during the Great Division. They have been able to hold onto Cloudsdale despite constant raids from the houses of Stormwing and Moon and Star. But holding onto such a place has cost them dearly.\n\nThe city lies in ruins from the constant battles, and the number of able fighting equines is running thin. The days of Cloudsdale are numbered and everypony within it knows it. It is just a matter of time before the city falls to the chaos that surrounds it.\n\nHowever, there are still many that have not lost hope. The memories of Equestria fueling the fires in their bellies. They keep fighting on, even now as all hope seems to be lost. They are willing to die for their dreams and memories of Equestria. But, there are others who only wish for the fighting to end so that the city may have a chance to survive. The question is now what will happen to Cloudsdale and the remnants of the Wonderbolts?"

   CLD_S0000: "The City Council’s Fateful Meeting"
    CLD_S0000_desc: "Members of the city council have gathered together within the ruins of city hall. There are many within the council whose faith in the Wonderbolts has been shaken. There are still those among them who still have faith in their city’s heroes, and want to believe they will save them."
    CLD_ES.000000.t: "The City Council’s Decision"
     CLD_ES.000000.d: "As the final member of the city council entered city hall, they locked the doors locked behind them. Making sure that no pony was able to leave until a solution had been decided upon. Once pleasantries were exchanged, discussion began in earnest. Hours would go by as the council members debated back and forth about what they should do. Tensions were quickly rising as the back and forth went on and on, especially between two members of the council; an old stallion named Lilac and a younger one by the name of Firecracker. Suddenly everything comes to a head as Lilac begins to yell at Firecracker.\n\n"Are you blind to the world we live in now, you fool..? Look outside, our city is in ruins and its citizens are scared. I want to see an end to all of this. Do you not as well? Or do you just wish to see our city continue to suffer because of your inability to see the obvious?!"\n\nThe other council members looked at one another in shock. Quietly murmuring with one another about the old stallion’s words."
     CLD_ES.000000.a: "That is until Firecracker began to speak again..."
     CLD_ES.000001.d: ""I want all of this fighting to come to an end as well, but I am not willing to look towards the ponies who are partly responsible for all of this for some kind of empty salvation. The Wonderbolts have done their best to protect us and will continue to do their best. They are the heroes of Cloudsdale. I know they will save us. You should know that better than any other pony of this council."\n\nFirecracker said this as he stared down Councillor Lilac with narrowing eyes, his eyes slowly falling upon the scuffed up Wonderbolt medal hanging from the stallion’s chest. Lilac would glare back with a similar look of disdain. Their argument only coming to an end by another member of the council begins to voice their own worries and concerns about the situation the city finds itself in.\n\nDebate between the city council members would continue to rage on for hours. Long into the night, and into the early hours of the morning, but one side would have to win out in the end. As the sun finally began to rise, the city council would leave their meeting place, a decision having been made..."
     CLD_ES.000001.a: "The council will support the Wonderbolts."
     CLD_ES.000001.b: "The council will send a message to Stormwing."

    CLD_SW0100_desc: "Before the collapse we did not need to worry about food or clean water. But times have changed, and we are running out of everything. We were Equestria's best and bravest, and now we have to resort to banditry to simply survive. Can we fall much further from grace?"

Now all we need is a place for them to take off and land. The fields beneath the city could work well enough, but it will take a little time to get the area suited enough for them."

     CLD_EWS.020100.d: "We've managed to rebuild a section of the city with the materials we currently posses, however there appears to not be enough mailable clouds to replace what has been damaged. We do however have enough material to construct new structures on the ground. While we wait for more clouds to be manufactured to overcome the pitfall, we should move our construction groundward. It will take some time to adapt our efforts however, so we'll have to put the project on hold for about two months."

The project has brought so much attention to the area that Hearthy, the mayor, is thankful to us for the much needed commerce. The small little town at Winterhome has grown considerably and is well on it's way to becoming something greater with time.\n\nOn another note, we've received word from the cloud factory in Cloudsdale that we've built up enough clouds to continue construction in the city. Perhaps now we can finish what we started."

     CLD_EWS.020102.d: "After some time we've completed what we set out to do in the sky city of Cloudsdale. The city has been repaired and our industry should allow us to hold out just a bit longer. While we may not have been able to expand parts of the city alongside our reconstruction efforts, we can be assured that our neighbors will appreciate us helping them out. Perhaps the Equestrian Dream isn't dead afterall."

We can not build such facilities in our floating city, however the town of Winterhome should be a good enough place to build some new mills."
   CLD_SW0301: "What It Means To Be A Wonderbolt"
    CLD_SW0301_desc: "What does it truly mean to be a Wonderbolt? To show bravery, dedication, and a determination like no other pony around you. There are quite a few ponies without wings who have shown they have what it takes to be a Wonderbolt. So why not welcome them into our ranks?"

Some builders think that they could get the machinery up and running again. They just need a little time."
   CLD_SW0303: "Sending Out Signals"
    CLD_SW0303_desc: "We believe that there are still Wonderbolts and members of the Equestrian military out there who have not given into the madness of the elements. If we send out some broadcasts on the old channels, maybe we will get them to come to us. Surely we can not be the only ones still out their fighting for Equestria."
   CLD_SW0400: "Helping The Infantry Keep Up"
    CLD_SW0400_desc: "The volunteers have the heart to fight, but with a lot of them not being pegasi they have difficulties keeping up. We have enough old trucks and other vehicles to make them far more mobile, however it is going to take time to get all the vehicles in working order and even more time to get those ponies trained to use them properly in combat."

We have some of the early design plans for the aircraft here in Cloudsdale. Given some time we may be able to make some prototypes or at least use the designs to help us develop something of our own."
   CLD_SW0402: "Their Armor Does Not Scare Us"
    CLD_SW0402_desc: "We may not have the resources to build many tanks of our own. But what we do have is the ingenuity and the bravery to face them even without armor. Before the division there were a few ideas flying around in the Equestrian military as to how we could fight such mechanical machines. Things such as anti tank rifles and modified artillery guns came to the forefront of those counters. It is about time that we take those old ideas and make them a reality."
   CLD_SW0500: "From Remnants To A Proper Military"
    CLD_SW0500_desc: "We have rebuilt our city, kept the light of Equestria burning through the night, and survived against all odds. We are more than just a collection of mere remnants and militias. We are survivors and as far as we know, we are the only bastion of Equestria and harmony left on this continent. We need to begin training the ponies who fight for us into proper soldiers."

   CLD_SS0100: "A Legion Approaches"
    CLD_SS0100_desc: "After Sending our call for help, many of the ponies on the city council were skeptical that former Wonderbolts would even come to the city's aid. But with time they had come to be pleasantly surprised."

    CLD_ESS.010000.t: "The Legion Reaches the City"
     CLD_ESS.010000.d: "A large group of soldiers had been spotted coming over the mountains, flying the banner of Stormwing as they marched. The Wonderbolts, fearing the worst, began to scramble, trying to prepare a defense of the city. They were expecting a fight, but the members of the city council knew what those soldiers were actually doing here. By nightfall the foreign soldiers had finally reached the outskirts of the city. A small army now stood just outside of the city, but they did not seem to be preparing for any kind of attack. In Fact they mostly just stood there, at the ready for the Wonderbolt of Cloudsdale to attack them. A few onlookers brave enough to poke out their heads, took note of the carts of food, water, and other supplies they had in tow behind them. Everypony was confused as to why they were here. That is until one of the numbers broke ranks and stepped forward before beginning to call out to anypony in the city that could hear him."
     CLD_ESS.010000.a: "Try to Listen"
     CLD_ESS.010001.d: ""Greetings to you my friends, I am Captain Ebn’ Flow, commander of this fine legion you see before you! I suppose you all were expecting some kind of fight, and you would be right to worry and prepare for such a thing. However, that is not why we have marched so far. Instead of battle, we come bringing good news to you! We have come because your city council members requested the aid of Rainbowdash and her cohort. Fear not citizens of Cloudsdale, as we are here to save you from these misguided ponies who call themselves Wonderbolts."\n\nThe ponies who were once ready to defend what was left of their once proud city began to look at one another with doubt and fear. They were tired, hungry, and now had the knowledge of the city council’s betrayal floating through their heads.\n\n"Please lay down your arms, there is no need to fight us!"\n\nWith their dwindling supplies and lack of numbers, the Wonderbolts began to step down. Allowing the foreign legion to march into the city unopposed. The ponies of Cloudsdale looked on in shock as they saw the banners of Stormwing fly through their streets."

    CLD_SS0201_desc: "Though the city council had willingly given over the city to my forces, I have reason to believe that there are a number of ponies within the city who pose a risk to the stability we bring. To ensure such a thing does not happen the Wonderbolts who resisted our liberation will be imprisoned. I am no monster however, I will put out an announcement and give them a little head start before we start hunting them down."
