   CLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When Equestria fractured during the Great Divide, Cloudsdale weathered the storm under the care of the Wonderbolts. Loyal to a fault the city on the clouds gathered to the Eqeustrian banner all who held the equestrian dream to their hearts. Yet tradgedy would strike when Rainbow Dash, the Element of Loyalty, caused a schism within the city and tore the defenders of Equestria in two. With the departure of a former hero of the Princessdom and many of her followers, the bastion of loyalty fractured and faded into the chaos gripping the nation. Now alone, Cloudsdale hangs by a feather. Amidst the coming turmoil the ponies of Cloudsdale must adapt to the winds of change or be engulfed by the maelstrom."

   CLD_S0000: "The City Council’s Fateful Meeting"
    CLD_S0000_desc: "Members of the city council have gathered together within the ruins of city hall. There are many within the council whose faith in the Wonderbolts has been shaken. There are still those among them who still have faith in their city’s heroes, and want to believe they will save them."
    CLD_ES.000000.t: "The City Council’s Decision"
     CLD_ES.000000.d: "As the final member of the city council entered city hall, they locked the doors locked behind them. Making sure that no pony was able to leave until a solution had been decided upon. Once pleasantries were exchanged, discussion began in earnest. Hours would go by as the council members debated back and forth about what they should do. Tensions were quickly rising as the back and forth went on and on, especially between two members of the council; an old stallion named Lilac and a younger one by the name of Firecracker. Suddenly everything comes to a head as Lilac begins to yell at Firecracker.\n\n"Are you blind to the world we live in now, you fool..? Look outside, our city is in ruins and its citizens are scared. I want to see an end to all of this. Do you not as well? Or do you just wish to see our city continue to suffer because of your inability to see the obvious?!"\n\nThe other council members looked at one another in shock. Quietly murmuring with one another about the old stallion’s words."
     CLD_ES.000000.a: "That is until Firecracker began to speak again..."
     CLD_ES.000001.d: ""I want all of this fighting to come to an end as well, but I am not willing to look towards the ponies who are partly responsible for all of this for some kind of empty salvation. The Wonderbolts have done their best to protect us and will continue to do their best. They are the heroes of Cloudsdale. I know they will save us. You should know that better than any other pony of this council."\n\nFirecracker said this as he stared down Councillor Lilac with narrowing eyes, his eyes slowly falling upon the scuffed up Wonderbolt medal hanging from the stallion’s chest. Lilac would glare back with a similar look of disdain. Their argument only coming to an end by another member of the council begins to voice their own worries and concerns about the situation the city finds itself in.\n\nDebate between the city council members would continue to rage on for hours. Long into the night, and into the early hours of the morning, but one side would have to win out in the end. As the sun finally began to rise, the city council would leave their meeting place, a decision having been made..."
     CLD_ES.000001.a: "The council will support the Wonderbolts."
     CLD_ES.000001.b: "The council will send a message to Stormwing."

   CLD_SW0100: "Desperation Forces Our Hooves"
    CLD_SW0100_desc: "Before the collapse we did not need to worry about food or clean water. But times have changed, and we are running out of everything. We were Equestria's best and bravest, and now we have to resort to banditry to simply survive. Can we fall much further from grace?"
    CLD_SW0100_cett: "§Y[CLD.GetName]§! will be able to conduct §Oraids§! on it's neighbors.\n§ONote that most targets are much stronger than us.§!"
    CLD_council_wonderbolts: "The council believes in the §6Wonderbolts§!."
   CLD_SW0200: "The Cloudsdale Air Field"
    CLD_SW0200_desc: "We still have a few old Equestrian fighters laying around. However given the state of most of them, we can only get a few working by salvaging parts from others. Now all we need is a place for them to take off and land. The fields beneath the city could work well enough, but it will take a little time to get the area suited enough for them."
   CLD_SW0201: "Rebuilding Cloudsdale"
    CLD_SW0201_desc: "All of the fighting has left the city in ruins, but we can rebuild. We must rebuild if we have any chance at survival in this cruel world."
    CLD_EWS.020100.t: "An Unexpected Cloudfall"
     CLD_EWS.020100.d: "We've managed to rebuild a section of the city with the materials we currently posses, however there appears to not be enough mailable clouds to replace what has been damaged. We do however have enough material to construct new structures on the ground. While we wait for more clouds to be manufactured to overcome the pitfall, we should move our construction groundward. It will take some time to adapt our efforts however, so we'll have to put the project on hold for about two months."
     CLD_EWS.020100.a: "Ponyfeathers!"
    CLD_EWS.020101.t: "Hearthy's Paradise"
     CLD_EWS.020101.d: "After some months of toil, we've managed to build a small industry in the quaint meadows around Winterhome. The project has brought so much attention to the area that Hearthy, the mayor, is thankful to us for the much needed commerce. The small little town at Winterhome has grown considerably and is well on it's way to becoming something greater with time.\n\nOn another note, we've received word from the cloud factory in Cloudsdale that we've built up enough clouds to continue construction in the city. Perhaps now we can finish what we started."
     CLD_EWS.020101.a: "Back to where it all began."
    CLD_EWS.020102.t: "Cloudsdale Reborn"
     CLD_EWS.020102.d: "After some time we've completed what we set out to do in the sky city of Cloudsdale. The city has been repaired and our industry should allow us to hold out just a bit longer. While we may not have been able to expand parts of the city alongside our reconstruction efforts, we can be assured that our neighbors will appreciate us helping them out. Perhaps the Equestrian Dream isn't dead afterall."

   CLD_SW0202: "The Cloudsdale Volunteers"
    CLD_SW0202_desc: "Groups of ponies have been coming forth and taking up arms to help us defend the city against the raiders and the chaos at its gates. They have been showing currouge many of us would have never expected from civilians. With a little training and equipment maybe they can become something more."
    CLD_SW0202_cett: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]§! will unlock the §YProvincial Militia§! template, gain two divisions of them, and be able to §3edit§!, §7train§!, and §Odisband§! new §Ydivision templates§!."
   CLD_SW0300: "Steel and Aluminum Mills In Winterhome"
    CLD_SW0300_desc: "Without the steel or aluminum coming from the heartland of Equestria, we can not supply our wonderbolts with the tools they need to protect the city. We can not build such facilities in our floating city, however the town of Winterhome should be a good enough place to build some new mills."
   CLD_SW0301: "What It Means To Be A Wonderbolt"
    CLD_SW0301_desc: "What does it truly mean to be a Wonderbolt? To show bravery, dedication, and a determination like no other pony around you. There are quite a few ponies without wings who have shown they have what it takes to be a Wonderbolt. So why not welcome them into our ranks?"

   CLD_SW0302: "Salvaging Our Old Uniform Factory"
    CLD_SW0302_desc: "There was a small factory here in Cloudsdale that put together the Wonderbolt uniform during better times. Ever since the raids on our city began, it has been sitting empty. Some builders think that they could get the machinery up and running again. They just need a little time."
   CLD_SW0303: "Sending Out Signals"
    CLD_SW0303_desc: "We believe that there are still Wonderbolts and members of the Equestrian military out there who have not given into the madness of the elements. If we send out some broadcasts on the old channels, maybe we will get them to come to us. Surely we can not be the only ones still out their fighting for Equestria."
   CLD_SW0400: "Helping The Infantry Keep Up"
    CLD_SW0400_desc: "The volunteers have the heart to fight, but with a lot of them not being pegasi they have difficulties keeping up. We have enough old trucks and other vehicles to make them far more mobile, however it is going to take time to get all the vehicles in working order and even more time to get those ponies trained to use them properly in combat."
    CLD_SW0400_cett: "Two regiments of §Ymotorized infantry§! will be raised."
   CLD_SW0401: "Revisiting The Spitfire Project"
    CLD_SW0401_desc: "Before the collapse of Equestria, the military was working on a new type of plane they dubbed the Spitfire. We have some of the early design plans for the aircraft here in Cloudsdale. Given some time we may be able to make some prototypes or at least use the designs to help us develop something of our own."
   CLD_SW0402: "Their Armor Does Not Scare Us"
    CLD_SW0402_desc: "We may not have the resources to build many tanks of our own. But what we do have is the ingenuity and the bravery to face them even without armor. Before the division there were a few ideas flying around in the Equestrian military as to how we could fight such mechanical machines. Things such as anti tank rifles and modified artillery guns came to the forefront of those counters. It is about time that we take those old ideas and make them a reality."
   CLD_SW0500: "From Remnants To A Proper Military"
    CLD_SW0500_desc: "We have rebuilt our city, kept the light of Equestria burning through the night, and survived against all odds. We are more than just a collection of mere remnants and militias. We are survivors and as far as we know, we are the only bastion of Equestria and harmony left on this continent. We need to begin training the ponies who fight for us into proper soldiers."
    CLD_SW0500_cett: "A division of §YEquestrian Infantry§! will be raised."

    CLD_S0701_desc: "As we begin to restore order and clean up the mess the cult left behind, we have started to come across these storehouses and designs of theirs. Guns, food, and even a few old planes they somehow managed to fashioned into fighters. We need to find as many of these stashes that we can. If they are anything like the ones we found already, there is no telling what all we could be in them."

    CLD_SW0800_desc: "No matter how much we wish or pray, the world outside our lands may be beyond saving. We simply do not have the ponies to retake Equestria. Even if we went as far as pressing every mare and stallion we had into service it would not be enough. The most that we can do is try to keep the light of Equestria burning on from within our borders. But to do that we must brace for whatever may come the best that we can."
   CLD_SW0900: "Rumors Of Other Equestria Holdouts"
    CLD_SW0900_desc: "As ponies fled into our lands, some of them brought with them rumors of a hold out of the Equestria military far to the north and east. Surely these are just rumors hearsay? There can not possibly still be loyalists like us out there?"
    CLD_EWS.090000.t: "The Military Holdouts"
     CLD_EWS.090000.d: "According to the stories and rumors we have collected, there appear to be 2 other loyal holdouts of the Equestrian Military still out there. One on the border with the changelings, and another on some islands east of Stalliongrad. How could that be though? We have not picked up any broadcasts from them, nor have they responded to any of our own. If they were out there, we would have already known about them. Then again, why would so many ponies have similar stories if these holdouts did not exist. Is it worth looking into these rumors?"
