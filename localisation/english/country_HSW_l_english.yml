###Ideas###
HSW_idea: "We bring the thunder!"
 HSW_idea_desc: "Fueled by their desire to bring back the ancient glory of Pegasi military dominance, House Stormwing watches the unraveling chaos from up above. Believing it is the duty of the military to hold the realm together in the absence of its rulers, they carefully weigh the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and wait for a perfect moment to strike. And when opportunity presents itself, they attack. A swarm of wings and spears assisted by the wrath of the sky itself - storms and tornadoes - swoops down on its unsuspecting prey. Without warning, without mercy - this is the way of House Stormwing, the Way of the Pegasi. Just how it once was, just how it always will be."
