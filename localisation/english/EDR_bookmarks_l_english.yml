   EQUESTRIA_DIVIDED_NAME: "The Great Divide"
   EQUESTRIA_DIVIDED_DESC: "An era of peace has dawned on Equestria. The sisters disappeared at the height of the Second Crystal War with Sombra, yet the Sun and Moon continue to rise. The faith and trust of Equines everywhere has suffered a massive blow with this revelation giving way to fear, doubt, and uncertainity. Unparalleled violence has engulfed the once united land of friendship as several factions, some even lead by the remaining elements, try to restablish what has been lost. In this new era of chaos the Equestrians must either solidify their identity or lose everything they once held dear."
