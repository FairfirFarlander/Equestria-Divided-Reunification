###Ideas###
HEF_idea: "Wherever we go, the forest will follow."
 HEF_idea_desc: "Often called the House of the Outcasts and the Unwanted, House Everfree is a true enigma on the current political map of Equestria. Nopony knows what to expect of their leader and her followers. They've become more ferocious and unpredictable than the very beasts they ride into battle. Often accused of such depraved acts as cannibalism and blood sacrifice, it has become apparent that they want nothing to do with the civilized world as we know it. Do they seek to destroy it? One thing is sure: shall Lady Fluttershy scream in fury, the warbands of Everfree will follow. And wherever they go, the forest will follow."
