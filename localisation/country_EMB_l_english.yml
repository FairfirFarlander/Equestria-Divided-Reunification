###Homescreen Welcome###
EAW_WS_EMB:0"The Communes of Ember - The Children of the First Queen"
 EAW_WS_EMB_desc:0"It is nothing odd for one or even small collections of changelings to leave the changeling lands.  Whether it was to fleed, conquer new lands, or to even flee the tyranny of their homelands.  Many brave changelings have made the long journey across the continent.  The ones who make up this small little commune are no different.  No one seems to really know what hive they came from originally, or when they exactly came to the southern jungles.  What was known of them before the Great Dividing, portrayed them as a rather peaceful group of changelings.  As a group who partook in magic and ideas that were not so welcomed in the Changeling Lands.  They rarely left the jungles they called home.  So fairly few actually know about their existence.  Those who did know of them knew very little.  It was known that they had at least two villages deep within the jungle.  However no one seemed to be able to figure out just how large these villages were or where they were.  It was also known that they would trade potions to the neighboring towns for supplies.  Their skills in alchemy helped to drive away many sicknesses in the region.\n\nAs Equestria began to fall into dark clutches of chaos, this group of changelings found themselves surrounded by madness as Equestria began to fracture.  The changelings wanted to help those around them and began traveling to some of the nearby towns more frequently rendering what medical aid they could.  Riots continued to rage, becoming more and more violent in the towns and cities surrounding them.  Many of the leaders in the commune began to fear the worst was to come soon, and ordered the villages to be fortified and expanded.  However, they knew the task would not be easy.  Then an idea came to the idea of one of the oldest drones of the commune’s leadership.\n\nThese changelings had dug out and already had been using underground tunnels for traversing the jungles.  A safe underway passage to avoid the dangers and heat of the jungle.  Knowing this, and weighing their options the village leaders gave the order.  Mass construction efforts were undertaken to ensure the safety of those who called the commune home.  The tunnels were quickly expanded as Equestria began to divide into smaller nations.  The villages of the commune were moved into the tunnels, which quickly were becoming larger and larger by the day.  They worked with a religious fervor. They carved new homes, roads, and eventually whole new villages into the stone of the tunnels.  This new life in the underways may help them in the short term, but the leaders of the commune know the surrounding nations may very well come for them.  They will have to fortify even more, and even lash out if need be.  The question is, who will be the leaders to lead them through the coming storms?"

   EMBact01.01.d:0"Leaders! The last few weeks have been largely successful. We've moved a number of our communes into the underway. According to our records however some of our kin are unaccounted for. It is time to count heads. We have to make sure that we do not forget anyone above ground."

   EMBact01.03.d:0"At last the great migration to our new home has concluded. Celebration has broken out in the tunnels and enclaves. Merry and joy has taken root in our hearts and minds, flowing into the evening with song. Many rowdy songs and speeches are uttered as the festivities wear into the endless night. Perhaps in this paradise we may finally create our underground utopia."
   EMBact01.03.a:0"The Underway and First Queen will protect us from the horror’s above!"
 EMB_S01:0"Our Future Underground"
  EMB_S01_desc:0"The Underway could be the key to surviving the chaos above our heads. However many are uncertain about who should lead us. The leaders of the villages should know what to do, Right? Nothing could go wrong this far under the ground."

 EMB_S02A:0"A Royal Idea"
  EMB_S02A_desc:0"It has come to our attention that a few of the commune leaders wish to build a few grand gardens in the underway, like those in our old home land. Normally we would not indulge many of their ideas, but there could be potential here. The gardens could provide us with food and may bring quite a bit of joy to all of us in the Underway. However it will take time for the gardens to grow. Should we pursue this idea?"
   EMBact01.05.t:0"The Terraces Are Prepared"
    EMBact01.05.d:0"We have dug out the nessesary room to begin planting various plants and vegetation, however there is only so much room as of the moment. Thus the council has deliberated on what to purpose the first terraces of soil for. There are two camps of thought on the matter. One group wishes to plant various vegatables for the coming days to lessen the dangers of potential famine. The other group wishes to plant botanical fauna and flora to lift our spirits during these trying times. Drones within both groups have come to realize perhaps we could meet both means, alloting appropriate space to each purpose. Regardless of the outcome the gardens are prepared for whatever we may end up using them for."

 EMB_S03A:0"The Beginning of Troubles"
  EMB_S03A_desc:0"Dear leaders, the world above is much worse off than we thought. Although we can not confirm any of the reports, some of our militia are reporting the rioting and chaos around our land is not getting any better. The commune leaders are starting to become uneasy with our situation, and many are pressing the expansion of our militias and defences."

 EMB_S03C:0"There Is Not Enough Room!"
  EMB_S03C_desc:0"Dear leaders, there is not enough room in the Underway for everyone to move back and forth in the tunnels. We underestimated just how many of us there are. We need to expand them before we completely run out of room. If we do not, something bad may happen."
 EMB_S04A:0"Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble"
  EMB_S04A_desc:0"Council members, all the troubles we are going through is causing the drones to get uneasy. There are rumours of some wishing to lash out and change the Underway. What will we do? What can we do? Even if it is not true the rumours alone will cause a panic in the tunnels…"
 EMB_S04B:0"We Cannot Keep Up With demand!"

  EMB_S05_desc:0"Dear leaders, council, comrades, a large party of drones are marching this way demanding changes and to be heard. It appears that they are rallying behind some leader, but we can not see who it is. What are we going to do?! This could result in revolution!"

 EMB_CS00_desc:0"Traitors my dear leaders, traitors the lot of them. We must do something about them, make an example of them. We must do everything in our power to make sure that this does not happen again. It is time for dramatic measures…!"
 EMB_CS01:0"Seeking Out the Traitors"
 EMB_CS01_desc:0"Fellow members of the council, as we all know just days ago members of the commune stormed the halls of our capital. We need work on stopping this from happening again. The Tunnel’s core offers up talks to form special ideas to deal with them."
 EMB_CS02A:0"A Lamp On Every Corner"
 EMB_CS02A_desc:0"The lower members of the council put forth the motion to improve the lighting of Ember. They have fears that the traitors that remain move in the darkness. Hiding away like the vermin they are. A motion is brought forward to increase the lighting for the mitila in the city streets. Raise more light posts and give the mitila mining helmets with lamps!"
 EMB_CS02B:0"Power of Crystals"
 EMB_CS02B_desc:0"Members of the council, loyal drones in the engineering and alchemical unions have come to us with designs for special weapons. Weapons that could burn through 20 creatures in a single shot. They believe that once these weapons are completed it will send terror into the traitors. We should pursue any advantage our loyal drones can give us over those who would seek to destroy what we have made!"
 EMB_CS03A:0"The Foundations of a Proper Military"
 EMB_CS03A_desc:0"The militias simply do not have the proper training to deal with traitors lurking around the streets of our commune. We have old texts from our old homes. We should look to them for ideas and use them to teach our brave loyal drones!"
 EMB_CS03B:0"More to the Militias"
 EMB_CS03B_desc:0"The militias need to be expanded so that we can cover more areas inside of the communes. Fellow council members we have no option but to start recruiting more drones for the defence of the capital. Expand the food rations of the militias so that they get more food than most other jobs in the commune. Yes our drones will go hungry, but more will willingly join the ranks!"
 EMB_CS03C:0"A Ear in the Underway"
 EMB_CS03C_desc:0"Council members, the highest ranking among us, have brought forth the ideas of forming special groups to be our eyes and ears in the Underway. Many drones may have issues with this, but we need to make sure the radicals and traitors are not allowed to spread their ideas. We must pass this in order to keep our drones and ourselves safe!"
 EMB_CS04:0"Fears of Another Strike"
 EMB_CS04_desc:0"Brothers and sisters of the council, we can not simply encore the fact that these traitors may very well come to attack us or rally support at the festivals the church puts on. We must put a end to these festivals before the ramble can use them to drum up more support!"
 EMB_CS05:0"The Traitors Show Themselves"
 EMB_CS05_desc:0"Strikes have been forming in the streets, brothers and sisters. Our eyes and ears point to members of the Church who are the ones helping these protests organise. It is clear that the church is full of traitors to the council. We must begin moving against them now before they threaten us more!"
 EMB_CS06:0"The Beginning of the End for Faith"
 EMB_CS06_desc:0"Members of the council, I can feel something lingering in the air of the Underway. The church is brewing ideas counter to those of the communes. I know that they are! It is time that we gather the militia and begin marching on them. We must round them up, and soon!"
 EMB_CS07:0"The End to a Faith"
 EMB_CS07_desc:0"Brothers and sisters of the communes, the followers of the First Queen have shown themselves to be traitors to our ideas, our values, and your souls. They have led their flock to march against us, the council and you! March with us and round up these traitors!"
 EMB_CS08:0"To Kill a God"
 EMB_CS08_desc:0"It comes down to this fellow council members. The members of the church are either in custody or in hiding. It has come time to decide what we should do with the church, the text, and the members. My fellow members of the council, are you ready to kill not just a idea, but a god!?"
 EMB_CS09:0"Flames to the Texts"
 EMB_CS09_desc:0"Brothers, sisters, council members; pires have been built in the centers of all of the communes in Ember. We await your word to begin burning the texts of the traitors. The youngest among us seem to be the most ready to burn things. This alone will not bring a complete end to the traitors but it will be a devastating blow!"
 EMB_CS10:0"Chisel to the Stone"
 EMB_CS10_desc:0"Fellow council members, as we speak there are militia and average members of the commune are taking chisels to the buildings and statues of the First Queen cult. This blight in our society will soon come to an end."
 EMB_CS11:0"Stakes for the Faithful"
 EMB_CS11_desc:0"Dear leaders, I bring with me wonderful news. We are ready to judge the traitors of The First Queen. What shall we do with them all? Surely the flock will be treated differently from the preachers. Or do they all deserve punishment?"
 EMB_CS12:0"The Absence of Faith"
 EMB_CS12_desc:0"With the Children of The First Queen gone, many in the Underway feel as if the tunnels are just a little bit emptier and darker. The ringing of bells, prayer, and merriment used to fill the air of the tunnels. Now all that is left is fear, order, and the sound of militia marching in the air."
 EMB_CS13:0"The Wrath of the Council"
 EMB_CS13_desc:0"Fellow council members, a few drones of the engineering union believe that they can reinvent those great cannons our old home used. With these weapons we believe that we can bring the true wrath of the council down upon our enemies."
 EMB_CS14:0"Queen Narratek Speaks Out Against Us"
 EMB_CS14_desc:0"Council members, the queen of the hive has spoken out against us. Calling us traitors and for us to resign. Surely she can not be serious, can she? In her blinded ignorance she does not see the dangers those rebels and ideas have on our communes. We should tame her speech before she does something we will all regret!"
 EMB_CS15:0"What a Waste of Life"
 EMB_CS15_desc:0"Dear leaders, a member of the council and head alchemist has put forth a proposition that would help… Replace… The loss of those who betrayed us. He has the resources needed, however he needs... New spaces dug out in the depths of the Underway and a… volunteer... Brothers and sisters remember what we are voting for."
 EMB_CS16:0"The Rule of Fear"
 EMB_CS16_desc:0"Members of the council, many of our drones appear to be afraid of us now. Now why would that be? Are they afraid that we will find out they hold traitorous thoughts as well? Members of the militia council push forward motions to begin going door to door and searching for the material of traitors!"
 EMB_CS17:0"Introducing a Police Force"
 EMB_CS17_desc:0"Not all of the drones on our streets can be trusted council members. We should vote on a motion to raise a policing force. We wished that this day would not have come. However it is no longer an option. It is our duty to bring about a group to protect us!"
 EMB_CS18:0"Increasing the Policing"
 EMB_CS18_desc:0"Fellow council members, it must be brought to our attention that we simply do not have enough drones in our militias to patrol our streets. A motion must be raised to introduce a conscription. Every drone must serve the communes in some way!"
 EMB_CS19:0"None Can Be Trusted"
 EMB_CS19_desc:0"We can not trust those around us, brothers and sisters. All those around us would wish for the traitors to ruin our communities and bring us to a end!"
 EMB_CS20:0"We Must Prepare for Anything and Everything!"
 EMB_CS20_desc:0"The defencise we have made are simply not enough! Council members, the builders league are ready to expand the fortresses we have. Council members, we simply can not pass up such a chance to raise our defences!"
 EMB_CS21:0"The Beginning of Our Raids"
 EMB_CS21_desc:0"A leader of one of our militias has sent a letter to the council proposing an idea for a possible raid. He suggests that we could conduct a raid on the nation to our south. It will help finally ease the food issues our commune faces. However, war may break out as a result. If it does and we win, it just means more arable land for our farmers."
 EMB_CS22:0"Our Neighbors Had the Answer"
 EMB_CS22_desc:0"It would appear that the raids we could do could hold much more profit than we anticipated. Our militias need the training that these raids could provide, and all of the food we gather from them proves to help keep our bellies full. Perhaps we could also use them to gather the love we have been lacking for so long…"
 EMB_CS23:0"The Underway Will Never Fall!"
 EMB_CS23_desc:0"Council members, the leaders of the militias have come to us with ideas and plans to make sure those above ground will never bring us to an end!"
 EMB_CS24:0"We Invite Those Who Would Attempt"
 EMB_CS24_desc:0"Those around us may try to bring us to an end. However we will raise our armies and meet them head on. The sun will never set on the Underway! We invite all of them to try!"
#Diplomacy Tree
EMB_D00:0"A Hoof on the World Stage"

 EMB_D01A:0"Freinds in the Mountain"
 EMB_D01A_desc:0"There are stories that thestras in the mountains to the north are not to be trusted by many, just like us. Perhaps we can find a friendship in that? We should send diplomats and gifts to them. We can learn much and protect one another in these trying times."
 EMB_D01B:0"What Can We Offer for Trade"
 EMB_D01B_desc:0"We need to start exporting and trading with our neighbors. It would bring in much needed food and maybe other resources. But, we remember the stories and tales about how most ponies treat our kind. We can not expect much. However, it is worth a try."
 EMB_D02:0"Setting Sail"
 EMB_D02_desc:0"Trading with other nations should continue to be something that we pursue. However our tunnels only reach so far and the jungles can not be traversed so easily. Perhaps we should take an idea from a few of the commune fishers and build proper trading vessels?"
 EMB_D03:0"Freinds of Fire"
 EMB_D03_desc:0"There are tales of a land out at sea that is filled with scaly beasts. Dragons, a whole land of dragons. Perhaps they could make good trading partners. After all they will surely have resources that we could only dream of. Those dragons may also prove to be more than just trading partners in the feature."
#Army-Diplomacy Tree
 EMB_LD02:0"The Moon and Earth"
 EMB_LD02_desc:0"We were right to work with those in the mountains. I think it is high time that we offer not just our friendship but also arms. We may not be capable of much. But with one another we can stand up to anyone and anything in our way."
 EMB_LD03:0"Moon, Earth, and Fire"
 EMB_LD03_desc:0"Those scaly things across the sea have been fairly good trading partners. However we have come to find out that they appear to be rejects like us. No one seems to trust them because of their greed. Perhaps if we indulge their greed a little and gain a friend?"

EMB_L00:0"A Fortress in the Making"
 EMB_L00_desc:0"The villages above we used to call home may still yet have a use. Have some of strone we gathered from creating ember moved to the surface and use it to start building walls. The old village above Ember can be converted into a fortress with a little bit of time and construction."
 EMB_L01A:0"Training With Nature"
 EMB_L01A_desc:0"We have not lived in these hash jungles for long but we have learned the ways of surviving in these lands. Perhaps we could use that to our advantage. After all, no one can fight better in the jungle than those who work with nature."
 EMB_L01B:0"No Stone Not Put to Use"
 EMB_L01B_desc:0"We still have plenty of stone laying about after the construction of the first fortress above Ember. Perhaps we can use them to shore up defences there and build the other old villages into fortresses as well."
 EMB_L01C:0"Proper Training and Equipment"
 EMB_L01C_desc:0"Our militias need proper training and proper weapons. A few soldiers did come to this new land with us so they could offer some training, and some engineers may have some ideas for weapons for our soldiers."
 EMB_L02A:0"Timber Wolf Riders"
 EMB_L02A_desc:0"It has come to the attention of militia leaders that we need a group of soldiers who can strike back fast and hard against any sort of raiding parties from the jungle to our west. If we can not stop them soon we may have to do something drastic. Hopefully it does not come to that."
 EMB_L02B:0"A End to the Raids"
 EMB_L02B_desc:0"We need to bring these raids to an end before more of our communes get hurt. However we fully admit that we are not ready for a full scale war against those barbarians. Perhaps we could slowly push them back over time. Perhaps through something such as border wars? Maybe if we push them back far enough we could strike them down for good!"
 EMB_L03:0"To Control Our Coast"
 EMB_L03_desc:0"We may have the jungles and our militias protecting us on the land. However, what do we have protecting our rivers and coast line…? We should move forward with ideas to have at least a few small ships for coastal defences."
 EMB_L04:0"Converting Our Largest Fishing Vessels"
 EMB_L04_desc:0"We just got amazing news! Some of the fishing crews from the coast are gifting their boats for the defence of their homeland. It does not sound like much, but they are ships made of steel. With a few conversions and tinkering we could turn them into vessels ready to do battle!"
 EMB_L05:0"More Docks For Our Growing Navy"
 EMB_L05_desc:0"We have pushed the raiders back far and have gained new territory in the process. Some of that land looks like it could be used for new dock yards for trading and our navy."
 EMB_L06:0"Birds of Prey"
 EMB_L06_desc:0"It has been brought to our attention that we may need something to fight winged things in the air. Even though we live in the Underway, our fortresses and cost line may need something to help defend them. Perhaps as simple as a large cannon could do the trick?"
 EMB_L07:0"A Discovery That Could Change Everything"
 EMB_L07_desc:0"One of our fishing vessels found the wreck of a massive ship just off the coast! We do not know how long it has been down there but it looks like we may be able to get it functioning again with time."
