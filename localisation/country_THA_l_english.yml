#Initial Story Tree
THA_S00:0 "The Mountain Stands Strong"
 THA_S00_desc:0 "The time has come for my armies to return to our homes.  At long last we can return to our mountain and be at peace.  However, I fear that deep down I know our neighbors will try once again to harm us.  I will not yet tell my soldiers my fears.  They deserve a chance to rest and see their families.  For now let us return and celebrate what victories we can.  For I fear that even darker days lay ahead of us."
