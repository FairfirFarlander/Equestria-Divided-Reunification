 THA_S00:0"The Mountain Stands Strong"
  THA_S00_desc:0"The time has come for my armies to return to our homes. At long last we can return to our mountain and be at peace. However, I fear that deep down I know our neighbors will try once again to harm us. I will not yet tell my soldiers my fears. They deserve a chance to rest and see their families. For now let us return and celebrate what victories we can. For I fear that even darker days lay ahead of us."

 THA_SD07A:0"Let Us Assess The Situation"
  THA_SD07A_desc:0"Our mountain is in a state of chaos. And now everyone in it is looking towards me for what to do. I am not my father, I do not have an answer for seemingly everything. But I have to come up with some kind of plan. With time I should be able to come up with something.”
 THA_SD07B:0"Reinforcing The City Walls"
  THA_SD07B_desc:0"I know that my mountain is in crisis. And with every day it seems as if this once utopian land becomes more and more hellish. We must begin efforts to shore up our defences and prepare for the darkness that lays ahead. We should start by rebuilding and reinforcing the walls at the city entrance. It will take a while but if anything will help us survive this chaos it will be the walls."
 THA_SD07C:0"Expanding The Workshops"
  THA_SD07C_desc:0"We must use this peace time wisely. We need to expand the workshops of the city into proper factories. Send building crews out and begin their expansion immediately!"
 THA_SD07D:0"Villager Militias"
  THA_SD07D_desc:0"After years of battle with our neighbors we were able to secure our place here in the south east, and even expand past the origin borders of our city state. But all of this has come at a grave cost to my Kingdom. We do not have an army big enough to cover all of this territory. Perhaps we should arm some of the local populace in the surrounding mountains and pay them a little gold. They will not be the best of fighters, but we are in need of soldiers."
 THA_SD08A:0"Bracing For What May Come Next"
  THA_SD08A_desc:0"The enemies of this mountain are many and still wish to see her toppled. We spent so many years trying to defend against those who wish us nothing but harm, and I will not see them succeed if they try again. Auburn believes we could learn a thing or two from his old equestrian tactic books. I will trust him and allow him to spread these with the troops."
 THA_SD08B:0"Addressing The Lack Of Food"
  THA_SD08B_desc:0"We were already struggling to feed everyone within this city before the fall of Equestria. Now, we truly can not feed everyone here. We can begin rationing the food we can grow, but soon we will have to find a more permanent solution. The ponies of this mountain will not stand for rationing like this forever."
 THA_SD08C:0"Telescopes and Binoculars"
  THA_SD08C_desc:0"If we could have some kind of more advanced warning of enemy positioning or the ability to see them from afar we may be able to get a small edge over our invaders."
 THA_SD08D:0"Sending Out Patrols"
  THA_SD08D_desc:0"The mountains that surround us are our protectors.  They can slow or even halt an enemy advance. However we can not rely on them for protection from everything. We must train a group of ponies to patrol the mountains and hold any enemies at bay within them."
