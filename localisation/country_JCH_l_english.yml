#Storyline Tree
JCH_S01:0 "The Underway Awaits!"
 JCH_S01_desc:0 "The villages of the Underway have been completed.  It is now time to begin moving the other members of the commune down into the Underway.  Gather the workers’ families first.  They should be the first to see the wonder!"
 JCH_S02:0 "Our Future Underground"
 JCH_S02_desc:0 "The Underway could be the key to surviving the chaos above our heads.  However many are uncertain about who should lead us.  The leaders of the villages should know what to do,  Right?  Nothing could go wrong this far under the ground."
 JCH_S03:0 "A Royal Idea"
 JCH_S03_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that a few of the commune leaders wish to build a few grand gardens in the underway, like those in our old home land.  Normally we would not indulge many of their ideas, but there could be potential here.  The gardens could provide us with food and may bring quite a bit of joy to all of us in the Underway.  However it will take time for the gardens to grow.  Should we pursue this idea?"
 JCH_S04A:0 "The Beginning of Troubles"
 JCH_S04A_desc:0 "Dear leaders, the world above is much worse off than we thought.  Although we can not confirm any of the reports, some of our militia are reporting the rioting and chaos around our land is not getting any better.  The commune leaders are starting to become uneasy with our situation, and many are pressing the expansion of our militias and defences."
 JCH_S04B:0 "The Cost of No Sun"
 JCH_S04B_desc:0 "Dear leaders, drones are beginning to struggle with the loss of the sun in their lives.  Some are wishing for the warm glow of the sun again.  However Many others are unsure about what to do.  We must gather the leaders and dress this at once."
 JCH_S04C:0 "There Is Not Enough Room!"
 JCH_S04C_desc:0 "Dear leaders, there is not enough room in the Underway for everyone to move back and forth in the tunnels.  We underestimated just how many of us there are.  We need to expand them before we completely run out of room.  If we do not, something bad may happen."
 JCH_S05A:0 "Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble"
 JCH_S05A_desc:0 "Council members, all the troubles we are going through is causing the drones to get uneasy.  There are rumours of some wishing to lash out and change the Underway.  What will we do? What can we do? Even if it is not true the rumours alone will cause a panic in the tunnels…"
 JCH_S05B:0 "We Cannot Keep Up With demand!"
 JCH_S05B_desc:0 "Dear leaders, we need the council to come up with some sort of plan to address the coming food shortage.  We have tried our best to keep everyone from panicking or realizing the shortages, but we can not keep up with demand."
 JCH_S06:0 "Unrest in the Underway"
 JCH_S06_desc:0 "Dear leaders, council, comrades, a large party of drones are marching this way demanding changes and to be heard.  It appears that they are rallying behind some leader, but we can not see who it is.  What are we going to do?! This could result in revolution!"
#Diplomacy Tree
JCH_D01:0 "A Hoof on the World Stage"
 JCH_D01_desc:0 "The time has come.  We can not wait in the shadows any longer and must begin seeking aid from those around us.  What will happen to us once the world knows we are here…?"
 JCH_D02A:0 "Freinds in the Mountain"
 JCH_D02A_desc:0 "There are stories that thestras in the mountains to the north are not to be trusted by many, just like us.  Perhaps we can find a friendship in that?  We should send diplomats and gifts to them.  We can learn much and protect one another in these trying times."
 JCH_D02B:0 "What Can We Offer for Trade"
 JCH_D02B_desc:0 "We need to start exporting and trading with our neighbors.  It would bring in much needed food and maybe other resources.  But, we remember the stories and tales about how most ponies treat our kind.  We can not expect much.  However, it is worth a try."
#Army-Diplomacy Tree
 JCH_AD03:0 "The Moon and Earth"
 JCH_AD03_desc:0 "We were right to work with those in the mountains.  I think it is high time that we offer not just our friendship but also arms.  We may not be capable of much.  But with one another we can stand up to anyone and anything in our way."
#Military Tree
JCH_A01:0 "A Fortress in the Making"
 JCH_A01_desc:0 "The villages above we used to call home may still yet have a use.  Have some of strone we gathered from creating ember moved to the surface and use it to start building walls.  The old village above Ember can be converted into a fortress with a little bit of time and construction."
 JCH_A02A:0 "Training With Nature"
 JCH_A02A_desc:0 "We have not lived in these hash jungles for long but we have learned the ways of surviving in these lands.  Perhaps we could use that to our advantage.  After all, no one can fight better in the jungle than those who work with nature."
 JCH_A02B:0 "No Stone Not Put to Use"
 JCH_A02B_desc:0 "We still have plenty of stone laying about after the construction of the first fortress above Ember.  Perhaps we can use them to shore up defences there and build the other old villages into fortresses as well."
 JCH_A02C:0 "Proper Training and Equipment"
 JCH_A02C_desc:0 "Our militias need proper training and proper weapons.  A few soldiers did come to this new land with us so they could offer some training, and some engineers may have some ideas for weapons for our soldiers."
 JCH_A03A:0 "Timber Wolf Riders"
 JCH_A03A_desc:0 "It has come to the attention of militia leaders that we need a group of soldiers who can strike back fast and hard against any sort of raiding parties from the jungle to our west.  If we can not stop them soon we may have to do something drastic.  Hopefully it does not come to that."
 JCH_A03B:0 "A End to the Raids"
 JCH_A03B_desc:0 "We need to bring these raids to an end before more of our communes get hurt.  However we fully admit that we are not ready for a full scale war against those barbarians.  Perhaps we could slowly push them back over time.  Perhaps through something such as border wars?  Maybe if we push them back far enough we could strike them down for good!"
