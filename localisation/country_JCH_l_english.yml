#Storyline Tree
JCH_S1:0 "The Underway Awaits!"
 JCH_S1_desc:0 "The villages of the Underway have been completed.  It is now time to begin moving the other members of the commune down into the Underway.  Gather the workers’ families first.  They should be the first to see the wonder!"
 JCH_S2:0 "Our Future Underground"
 JCH_S2_desc:0 "The Underway could be the key to surviving the chaos above our heads.  However many are uncertain about who should lead us.  The leaders of the villages should know what to do,  Right?  Nothing could go wrong this far under the ground."
 JCH_S3:0 "A Royal Idea"
 JCH_S3_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that a few of the commune leaders wish to build a few grand gardens in the underway, like those in our old home land.  Normally we would not indulge many of their ideas, but there could be potential here.  The gardens could provide us with food and may bring quite a bit of joy to all of us in the Underway.  However it will take time for the gardens to grow.  Should we pursue this idea?"
 JCH_S4:0 "A Alchemical Idea"
 JCH_S4_desc:0 "Leaders of the commune hear my words please!  A few of The alchemists and medicine makers believe that they may have a plan to help the gardens grow and the lack of light.  They are requesting an audience with you all, but need time to gather their works.  Will you hear them?"

#Diplomacy Tree
JCH_D1:0 "A Hoof on the World Stage"
 JCH_D1_desc:0 "The time has come.  We can not wait in the shadows any longer and must begin seeking aid from those around us.  What will happen to us once the world knows we are here…?"
 JCH_D2A:0 "Freinds in the Mountain"
 JCH_D2A_desc:0 "There are stories that thestras in the mountains to the north are not to be trusted by many, just like us.  Perhaps we can find a friendship in that?  We should send diplomats and gifts to them.  We can learn much and protect one another in these trying times."
 JCH_D2B:0 "What Can We Offer for Trade"
 JCH_D2B_desc:0 "We need to start exporting and trading with our neighbors.  It would bring in much needed food and maybe other resources.  But, we remember the stories and tales about how most ponies treat our kind.  We can not expect much.  However, it is worth a try."
#Army-Diplomacy Tree
 JCH_AD3:0 "The Moon and Earth"
 JCH_AD3_desc:0 "We were right to work with those in the mountains.  I think it is high time that we offer not just our friendship but also arms.  We may not be capable of much.  But with one another we can stand up to anyone and anything in our way."
#Military Tree
JCH_A1:0 "A Fortress in the Making"
 JCH_A1_desc:0 "The villages above we used to call home may still yet have a use.  Have some of strone we gathered from creating ember moved to the surface and use it to start building walls.  The old village above Ember can be converted into a fortress with a little bit of time and construction."
 JCH_A2A:0 "Training With Nature"
 JCH_A2A_desc:0 "We have not lived in these hash jungles for long but we have learned the ways of surviving in these lands.  Perhaps we could use that to our advantage.  After all, no one can fight better in the jungle than those who work with nature."
 JCH_A2B:0 "No Stone Not Put to Use"
 JCH_A2B_desc:0 "We still have plenty of stone laying about after the construction of the first fortress above Ember.  Perhaps we can use them to shore up defences there and build the other old villages into fortresses as well."
 JCH_A2C:0 "Proper Training and Equipment"
 JCH_A2C_desc:0 "Our militias need proper training and proper weapons.  A few soldiers did come to this new land with us so they could offer some training, and some engineers may have some ideas for weapons for our soldiers."
 JCH_A3A:0 "Timber Wolf Riders"
 JCH_A3A_desc:0 "It has come to the attention of militia leaders that we need a group of soldiers who can strike back fast and hard against any sort of raiding parties from the jungle to our west.  If we can not stop them soon we may have to do something drastic.  Hopefully it does not come to that."
 JCH_A3B:0 "A End to the Raids"
 JCH_A3B_desc:0 "We need to bring these raids to an end before more of our communes get hurt.  However we fully admit that we are not ready for a full scale war against those barbarians.  Perhaps we could slowly push them back over time.  Perhaps through something such as border wars?  Maybe if we push them back far enough we could strike them down for good!"

JCHact1.1a.d:0 "Leaders! The last few weeks have been largely successful. We've moved a number of our communes into the underway. According to our records however some of our kin are unaccounted for. It is time to count heads. We have to make sure that we did not forget anyone above ground."

JCHact1.1b.t:0 "The Finishing Touches"
JCHact1.1a.d:0 "We have worked long and hard, but the villages of the underway have finally been completed.  Maybe now we can rest easy.  At least for a little while."
